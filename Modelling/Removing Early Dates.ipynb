    "Introduction to notebook:\n",
    "In this notebook, we will address the following problem: Videos that were posted more recently (closer to the date March 1,2025) have been around for a shorter amount of time and thus will have slightly less views. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to exclude from our data all videos that are so recent that they have significantly less views than they \"should.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of notebook and conclusions:\n",
    "We found that the overall variability in the views means that being just one standard deviation away is a negative number. This means there is so much variability in the views that it is hard to say a video has abnormally low views without further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we did next was compute the mean number of views per week for each week of the data set. \"Average views per week\" is the new variable with a new mean (mu) and a new standard deviation, which is much lower. We then assessed each week, and see if it had a significantly lower mean. We saw that the first 8 weeks of the data had a mean one standard deviation away from mu, but almost all other weeks had a mean that was within one standard deviation from mu. This is a clear pattern that indicates the \"newer\" data has slightly lower views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all weeks were within two standard deviations from the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, to be safe we excluded all data from the first 8 weeks. Our threshold for what is considered \"abnormally low\" was to be only one standard deviation away, but there is no shortage of data for us to consider for our analysis so we are safe to exclude data. "
