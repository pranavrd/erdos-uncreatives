The color is a gorgeous chocolate brown, the formula doesn‚Äôt flake or smudge, it removes easily with warm water, and it ACTUALLY HOLDS A CURL.

I did a 7 hour wear test and by the end of the day, my lashes were still lifted. It was amazing.

I only use tubing mascaras because I can‚Äôt be bothered to take the time to remove traditional formulas, so I have tried a LOT over the years. Most of them make my lashes fall flat after a few minutes but not this one! It‚Äôs a total revelation for me.

Rudi, you killed it again. üç´ üëèüèº

This rich, luxurious cream provides 48 hours of deep hydration and strengthens your skin barrier, protecting it from environmental damage. üåøüí™ Formulated with Idebenone, a superior antioxidant that outperforms Vitamin C and CoQ10, it helps rejuvenate your skin, improve texture, and prevent premature aging. üõ°Ô∏è‚ú®

Infused with Blackberry Complex, rich in anthocyanins, and packed with five types of ceramides and hyaluronic acid, it nourishes and fortifies every layer of your skin. üåüüå∏ Its golden, concentrated texture melts into the skin, leaving it deeply moisturized, refreshed, and glowing! ‚ú®üçØ

Pro Tip: For best results, use it as part of your nighttime skincare routine! üõèÔ∏è Apply generously to your face and neck after cleansing and toning, and wake up with a refreshed, revitalized complexion! üåô I even use it under my eyes ‚Äì no stinging or irritation! My fine lines and dryness have improved significantly. üôå While it takes time to see full results for my wrinkles, I‚Äôm already happy with the improvement, especially when I pair it with Medicube RF Ultra Tune 40.68, which helps promote skin firmness and volume. üí™‚ú®

Have you tried this yet? Let me know your go-to moisturizer! üí¨

These are a thinner matte lip cream that feel slightly balmy but very light weight. 

They smell like lemon coconut cookies to me, which is kind of nice. 

My lips feel a little dry as these wear but it's not bad. They aren't necessarily reinventing the wheel here, but it's a nice product if you want a comfortable matte lip.

He had a vision of those athletic, super defined arms and he just wasn't able to achieve them with his hard work in the gym. So, we went to work and carefully sculpted them out while grafting fat to his shoulders in order to round them. Many doctors are unwilling to perform liposuction in this area, as the anatomy is very delicate and requires only the utmost knowledge and skill. He chose us based on the high amount of results we post on our socials, so he felt extremely comfortable trusting us. We know the exact area to sculpt and were able to really define each critical area of his arms: his biceps, triceps, deltoid, and the shoulders. This latter portion was done by harvesting his fat, purifying it, and then grafting it into the shoulders in order to athletically round them, creating immaculate balance with his arms. We did more than just his shoulders and arms.
      As you can see, his chest and abs are in peak gladiator form. This was due to both the procedure, and his diligence post-procedure with the after-care protocol, eating right, working hard in the gym, and PEPTIDES such as MK-677 and CJC for muscle growth and growth hormone production. This stands as an excellent example of a patient who put in the work post-surgery to truly capitalize on and maximize his results.

Check out these incredible results from our patient‚Äôs session for female facial sculpting. With regular maintenance visits, fillers and Botox have kept her skin absolutely ageless and her features looking more chiseled / defined than ever before.

Today Dr. Emer is focusing on:
‚úÖ Middle face projection
‚úÖ Chin contouring
‚úÖ Jawline definition
‚úÖ Submalar hollow fills
‚úÖ Temple & eyebrow rejuvenation

üíâWe also injected Botox to the forehead + around the eyes for a smooth, lifted look and to the lower face for more jaw slimming.

No facial sculpting appointment is complete without a restock of EMER Skin:

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Kopari today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Homosalate, Octisalate, Octocrylene, and Avobenzone
- It has a gel texture
- No white cast on my skin tone¬†
- I notice a bit of residue in my facial hair
- Has a satin matte finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Doesn't sting my eyes
- Around 10-12 pumps to get the necessary amount needed for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- Around $38 for 44mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Sephora.
üîÜ
I was really intruiged by the finish of this one, very interesting. It is satin matte but it is made to give a glow. It has pearlescent minerals in it to give a subtle glow even though it as a whole is satin matte. I could feel the residue throughout the day anytime I touched my facial hair, and the pearlescent minerals for the glow were making my facial hair look a little gray to me. So I liked the finish, but this one is not the perfect one for me. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

The results are nothing short of transformative. His jawline now has the sharp, chiseled structure he envisioned, while subtle adjustments to his chin and midface created harmony and proportion. Enhancing his under-eyes gave him a refreshed and youthful appearance, and adding volume to the temples completed his strong, defined profile.

What‚Äôs remarkable about this transformation is how natural it looks. Every enhancement was carefully planned to work with his unique features, amplifying his best attributes while maintaining a masculine, sculpted appearance.

This patient‚Äôs journey is a reminder of how small changes can have a big impact. Confidence is transformative, and seeing him step into the best version of himself is what this work is all about.

If you‚Äôre ready to enhance your features and unlock your full potential, let‚Äôs talk. Your ideal look is within reach.

Sinks in and feels great on the skin. Like not sticky or greasy, but the finish is definitely radiant. Most oily skin people will probably find this too shiny. Let me know what you think! Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

762,0.0,False,7.0,90.0,"Foundation looking cakey? Here‚Äôs how to fix it with a few key tweaks:
(Save so you can come back to this)
1. Choose the Right Foundation for Your Skin Type:
Many people gravitate toward full-coverage foundations to cover skin concerns. However, full-coverage formulas are often rich in texture and matte, making them prone to looking cakey. Matte, full-coverage foundations can work well for oily skin, as they tend to last longer, but those with dry skin should avoid them. Personally, I recommend a medium-coverage foundation with a satin finish for any skin type. They‚Äôre buildable, offer great coverage, and suit all skin types. For oilier skin, using a quality setting powder and spray can help maintain a flawless base.

2. Adjust Skin Prep with the Seasons:
It‚Äôs essential to tailor your skin prep to your skin type and to the weather. In winter, for example, try adding a drop of your favorite face oil or moisturizer to your foundation to avoid it looking too cakey. A little seasonal adjustment goes a long way!

3. Choose Your Application Tools Wisely:
I like to use a mix of brushes, powder puffs, and sponges to achieve a smooth finish. Start by picking up minimal product with a brush and build coverage only where needed. After applying with a brush, go over the foundation with a lightly damp sponge to remove any excess product, blend edges, and smooth out the application.

4. Use Setting Spray Between Layers:
For fuller coverage, try misting setting spray between layers and then blending lightly with a sponge. This helps your foundation look fresh and extends its wear.

5. Avoid Overdoing Powder:
Setting powders are great for keeping oily areas in check, but overusing powder can make makeup look crusty and cakey. Always tap off excess powder from your brush or puff before applying to prevent buildup.

6. Be Patient and Embrace Your Skin‚Äôs Uniqueness:
Makeup is a skill that takes practice and experimenting with tools, techniques, and products. Be patient, and don‚Äôt expect perfection right away. Also, remember that real skin has texture, pores, and imperfections. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to the filtered, edited images you see online. Embrace your natural beauty!",Try these following tips next type for flawless looking base and stop foundation from caking,589.0,6.544444444444444,12,2024-11-11T18:52:16.000Z,0,False,0,1,0.07692307692307693,0.011864406779661017,True,False,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

‚ú®YesStyle Reward Code: BEAUTYKAT321 ‚ú®

I have been using J-Beauty sunscreens for decades - Shiseido Anessa, Canmake, Kao Biore, Kose Sekkisei, and Kanebo Allie! Among all these amazing sunscreens, Kanebo Allie has become my top fave! üëç

‚ù§Ô∏è It brightens my skin tone instantly without leaving a white residue. It gives me a natural dewy look but not sticky and it won‚Äôt irritate my watery eyes. üëÄ

I use it after toning and moisturizing for the face and body if I need to stay outdoors for long hours. It is waterproof and sweat-resistant so this sunscreen is perfect for water sports as well. üí¶

‚ù§Ô∏è But what impresses me is its reef-friendly formula. Most sunscreens contain an ultraviolet absorber called Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (also known as OMC), which causes heavy damage to a coral reef so several countries prohibit using OMC-contained sunscreens.

ü§© Kanebo Allie Gel Sunscreen UV EX renewed its formula, a non-OMC and coral reef-safe sunscreen with SPF50 protection. It is gentle on the skin yet provides powerful protection from UVA and UVB.

Features of Kanebo Allie Gel UV EX SPF 50+ PA++++:

‚úÖ Beach Friendly Formula - non-OMC and coral reef-safe sunscreen that can satisfy a legal requirement and the like.
‚úÖ Powerful UV protection of SPF 50+ and PA++++
‚úÖ Waterproof and sebum resistant. Won‚Äôt be smeared by towel, clothes, and face mask.
‚úÖ Contains Hyaluronic Acid which hydrates your skin and makes your skin look dewy.
‚úÖ Less sticky and greasy and can be easily rinsed off by a normal face cleanser or soap.
‚úÖ Can be used as a makeup base.

Guys, its cases like this that get me out of bed in the morning. This was a guy who had lost track of his body as he aged and one day he looked in the mirror and decided it was time for a change.  He had the typical ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù and wanted to upgrade to a sculpted, defined physique that showed off his natural definition. Together, we created a plan to get him there‚Äîand the results are nothing short of incredible.

Using my signature Gladiator Liposuction technique, I sculpted his torso to create a more lean look and enhance his natural definition. But we didn‚Äôt stop there. A tummy tuck was performed to address the significant amount of skin laxity he had on his abdomen. 

Another exciting portion of this procedure was PENIS ENHANCEMENT. He wanted to add a little extra something down under, so we grafted his own fat to his penis to build GIRTH AND LENGTH. Though he opted for his own fat, we also offer this treatment awake in office with dermal fillers which he may do later on!

What I love about this patient‚Äôs journey is that this was only the first step to his complete fitness overhaul. Post-surgery, he committed to peptides to accelerate recovery, improve muscle-building, and enhance his results as he hit the gym to build on the foundation we created. That dedication‚Äîthat drive to go beyond‚Äîis what inspires me and makes my work so rewarding.

When you work with me, you‚Äôre not just getting a procedure‚Äîyou‚Äôre getting an artist who sees every detail and a perfectionist who won‚Äôt settle for anything less than extraordinary. If you‚Äôre ready to take your body and confidence to the next level, you know where to find me. DM me, and let‚Äôs start your transformation!


Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California. Dr. Emer is behind some of Hollywood's most defined bodies, impeccable skin, and chiseled facial features. He is an aesthetic visionary who dares to be different.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Isntree today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Uvinul T 150, Mexoryl SX, Uvinul A Plus, Parsol SLX, and Tinosorb S
- It has a light fluid texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural finish
- No added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $18 for 50mL. Can be purchased from retailers like Stylevana or Yesstyle.
üîÜ
My first post of the year and we are back with a sunscreen review of course. This features red onion extract that is supposed to help soothe the skin and soothe breakouts. Feels weightless on the skin with a nice natural finish. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

The Lilybyred Tangle Jelly Balms are $9.79 on YesStyle 

Key ingredients: Hydrolyzed Collagen, Mango Seed Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Apricot Seed Oil and Passion Fruit Seed Oil.

Formula: a liquid lip balm with a glossy finish, and a cushiony, thick texture. It does feel a little oily on the lips, especially when the color wears off, but it‚Äôs not slippery. It‚Äôs ever-so-slightly sticky so if you want something that lasts a little longer than a lip oil, you‚Äôll like these. On the lips, they feel similarly to the Naturium phyto glow lip balms.

Finish: it has a slightly smoothing finish if you apply a good amount!

Packaging: this is where the product misses for me. The packaging is SO STIFF and difficult to squeeze, I genuinely have to squeeze it with two hands. I also don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs in a squeezey tube because I find the it can get a bit messy when applying the product. If this had been in packaging with a wand I would‚Äôve much preferred it, but for $9 I can‚Äôt complain.

Scent: it has an artificial apricot scent, definitely not my favorite because it smells quite chemically but it does disappear quickly.

Overall, I LOVE the formula, finish, colors, and pricepoint of these lip balms. State of Kait approved!

What do you think? Would you try these? .

Thanks to @tfit.global for sending me this makeup primer for review. I‚Äôve been using it for almost 2 weeks and I LOVE it!

Product Claims:

üå∏ Pore-Blurring Magic: Say goodbye to visible pores and hello to a smooth, airbrushed finish! This primer instantly minimizes pores, fine lines, and uneven texture for the perfect base.

üåü Smooth & Lightweight: The product has a silky, lightweight texture that feels like a second skin. It‚Äôs breathable without any greasiness.

üíñ Brighten with Pink Tint: The delicate pink tint enhances your skin complexion.

üí¶ Water & Sweat Proof: Stay flawless all day long! This primer is resistant to water and sweat, keeping makeup intact in any condition.

üíÑ 12-Hour Freshness: Lock in your makeup for up to 12 hours without smudging or caking. Keep your makeup looking fresh and flawless all day.

What do I think about it?

‚úÖ It doesn‚Äôt break me out or create a rubbery residue when I apply face powder or foundation on top of it.

‚úÖ It blurs my pores and makes them less visible.

‚úÖ The pink tint is a plus as it brightens my yellowish skin complexion, just as the product claims.

‚úÖ It doesn‚Äôt burn my eyes.

I live in Hong Kong, so the weather is hot üî• and humid üí¶. Under these conditions, I don‚Äôt think this primer can keep my makeup fresh for 12 hours, as my sebum and sweat oxidize the foundation and probably the makeup primer. My skin complexion turns ‚Äúyellow‚Äù again, closer to my natural skin tone after a few hours.

It‚Äôs not a typical makeup base that glides on the skin easily ‚Äî I have to squeeze the tube harder to get the product, then tug at my skin and use my fingers to apply the primer upward. These don‚Äôt bother me at all. In fact, this formula is better than a typical spreadable makeup base, which tends to melt and create residues when I put on foundation or touch up during the day.

968,24.0,False,581.0,89900.0,"Kulfi Beauty sent me their Lassi Lips Staining Long-Lasting Moisturizing Lip Oils and here are my thoughts:

These are $24 each and are described as a ‚Äúsmooth staining lip oil that goes on glossy, leaving a perfectly pigmented stain that lasts with one swipe and won‚Äôt feather, flake, or transfer.‚Äù

These are totally unscented and feel light-as-a-feather on the lips. They‚Äôre definitely unlike any other lip stain I‚Äôve tried, they truly feel weightless, like you‚Äôre just wearing a super light, watery lip oil. The stain they leave behind is even (not patchy) and I think the shade range is nice and balanced with a range for different skin tones.

I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre moisturizing or provide any long-lasting nourishment, but they are very comfortable and don‚Äôt feel drying.

I do have to warn you, my black cherry leaked from the top all over my desk. When I posted about it on my IG stories, I got quite a few messages from people saying their black cherry also had a defect and leaked from the top.

So I don‚Äôt feel confident saying you should buy the black cherry shade, but I didn‚Äôt have issues with any of the other colors.

Overall, I think these are a really nice launch from Kulfi, especially if you like products that are lightweight! I personally prefer brighter shades for my skin tone so I won‚Äôt be keeping any of these, but I can see a lot of people loving this launch.

- No white cast on my skin tone

Deeply moisturizing but lightweight and easy to blend in. Has a great texture but that is pretty much the only redeeming factor for me, so it's gonna be a pass. $140 is crazyyy for a sunscreen or moisturizer. I wish it had more protection than SPF 30, especially since I assume people would end up wildly underapplying. But if someone told me this was their ideal SPF, I wouldn't be surprised. The finish and look throughout the day is lovely. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Murad today! 
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a clear gel texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- Works fine in my facial hair
- Has a natural radiant finish
- Has added fragrance and essential oils, but I don't notice much of a scent
- Does not sting my eyes
- Water and sweat resistant
- Around $42 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their retailers like Sephora or their website.
üîÜ
I definitely did not get velvety matte from this. They did mention a few times on their website that this is meant to be nourishing, so maybe it is geared more to those closer to dry skin. I did find it a bit greasy and like it was a layer of slip sitting on my skin. Nice that there is no white cast and it is easy to apply. But definitely not my fave when it comes to this category of siliconey clear gel sunscreens. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

üíñ Thanks to @stylekorean_official for sending me this beautiful duo for the ultimate pink skin challenge! Let‚Äôs dive into the product details: üíñüí¶

üåπ @heimish_cosmetics @heimish_cosmetic Bulgarian Rose Water Hydrogel Eye Patch ‚Äì These multi-functional hydrogel patches help moisturize, brighten, and reduce wrinkles on the forehead, around the eyes, nose, and mouth. They adhere seamlessly, delivering active ingredients for maximum absorption. Plus, they can be dissolved in water and used as an essence!

üçâ @heimish_cosmetics @heimish_cosmetic Watermelon Moisture Soothing Gel Cream ‚Äì A moisturizing, cooling, and soothing gel cream that hydrates and restores the skin‚Äôs moisture balance with watermelon extract. Perfect for refreshing the skin, especially on hot days!

üí≠ My Challenge:

üíï Here‚Äôs how I did it - 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Applied a thick layer of Watermelon Gel Cream üçâ for deep hydration & a cooling sensation.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Placed the Bulgarian Rose Water Hydrogel Eye Patches üåπ all over my face (not just under the eyes or on laugh lines, but the WHOLE FACE) and waited 20‚Äì30 minutes for maximum absorption.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Removed the patches (no rinsing needed!) and gently massaged the remaining essence into my skin.

‚ú® My Thoughts:
At first, I was skeptical - should these two be used together? ü§î But after trying it, I LOVE the results! üòç It took me 10‚Äì15 minutes to layer both products, but I believe it‚Äôll be faster once I get used to the process.

üí° Pro Tip: The eye patches can slip a little, so I recommend lying down while using them.

üåü Final Verdict:
‚úÖ Instant glow & hydration that lasts all night! ‚ú®
‚úÖ No need to wait hours or overnight for results. ‚è≥
‚úÖ Subtle rose scent that‚Äôs just right for me. üåπ
‚úÖ My skin looks plump and radiant. Love it! üòç

Would you try this challenge? Let me know! üí¨üëá

Our patient's confidence has been hindered due to his acne scars. So, after seeing the results we're able to achieve when it comes to acne scars, he came to us for some help. For him, we did one of our famous acne scar combos consisting of: Bellafill to fill in and plump his deeper scars, Subcision to go under the skin and break up his scars, Pixel8 MNRF to improve textural irregularities, and our CO2 resurfacing laser to reduce his scars. With this roster, we set him up for success but we always go the extra mile- this time immediately after treatment we applied PRP + gave him an oxygen facial under our red light to expedite his healing. As this was his first treatment with us, we were able to see a significant improvement with his scars but to completely reduce them he will be coming back for another round of treatment. He is very excited with how smooth his skin looks, and constantly gets asked what his secret is for smooth skin. It's no secret- we are the best in the game!

I always wanted to try rice toner and finally, I got this viral facial toner and I love how hydrating it is! üí¶ I am talking about I‚Äôm from Rice Toner from Korea. This toner looks like a milky toner but it is weightless and designed for all skin types.üíßIt promotes skin hydration, improves skin complexion, and gives you a glowy result ‚ú®.

‚úàÔ∏è Since I didn‚Äôt have a toner pad with me while I was traveling, I used it as a toner and a quick facial mask as follows to restore my skin moisture and complexion:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Shake the toner and saturate the cotton pads with it.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Leave the saturated cotton pads on the cheek areas, which are the most dehydrated part of my face, for 5-10 mins. You can press the cotton pads gently to encourage skin absorption.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Wipe my face gently when I remove the cotton pads. This helps to eliminate dead skin cells while revealing the healthy complexion of my skin ‚ù§Ô∏è

So what is I‚Äôm from Rice Toner?

üåæ Infused with 77.78% Goami Extract for revitalizing dull-looking skin and delivering intensive moisture.
üß™ Contains Niacinamide to further boost the skin‚Äôs radiance.
üí¶ Toner leaves skin soft and supple with a refreshing finish.
üí™ Forms a protective barrier, preventing water loss and eliminating dead skin cells.
üíõ Double-layer moisturization - shake well to mix the water and emulsion layers. The milky texture of the toner ensures deeper moisturization and nourishment. üòç

1509,2.0,True,106.0,319000.0,"I‚Äôm here to take acne scars down for good ‚Äì and it takes a whole new level of true experience and expertise to make that happen.

When this patient came to me, he was tired of feeling held back by his scars. He‚Äôd tried all literally all of the usual solutions, but they just weren‚Äôt enough. I could tell he needed a high-impact procedure ‚Äì not something one-size-fits-all. So, I got to work, using a unique combination that I‚Äôve refined over years of experience to create the kind of results that turn heads! üòä

Here‚Äôs exactly how I approached his case to tackle his scars from every angle:

‚úÖBellafill ‚Äì a top choice of mine to fill in the deeper scars and restore volume, giving an immediate boost and long-term support as the skin rebuilds.

‚úÖSubcision ‚Äì one of my go-to techniques, where I go under the skin to break up those stubborn, tethered scars. This is critical in allowing the skin to finally smooth out.

‚úÖPixel8 ‚Äì another favorite, to target texture and kickstart collagen production, rebuilding his skin from the inside out.

‚úÖCO2 Resurfacing ‚Äì the final touch, to refine the skin‚Äôs surface and give it that fresh, renewed look.

Going above and beyond is what gives my patients the best possible results. After his session, I applied PRP along with an oxygen facial under red light therapy to kickstart healing and ensure he‚Äôd walk out glowing. Truthfully it‚Äôs all about taking that extra step and going beyond what‚Äôs expected to help patients see a real transformation.

Even after just one round, he is absolutely thrilled with his overall improvement! His friends are asking him about his skin, and he‚Äôs finally seeing what‚Äôs possible with combination treatments. When it comes to scars, I don‚Äôt settle for anything less than life-changing results.

If your acne scars are holding you back, let‚Äôs create a plan to make them a thing of the past.

üîÜ

- No white cast on my skin tone¬†
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a radiant finish
- No added fragrance
- Water and sweat resistant
- Definitely stings my eyes
- Around $15 for 60mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Stylevana or YesStyle. Code SHOPGSG for a discount on Stylevana.
üîÜ
Stings my eyes like crazy. Love the super fine mist though and that is it is very quick drying on the skin. Dries down like nothing. Hold your breath when you spray this lol. Might not be a face sunscreen spray because it says for body and hair. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Our patient saw us on Instagram and loved how we are able to get the absolute best facial sculpting results. He came to us with specific concerns, such as the hollowness of his under-eyes area. He also desired a stronger jawline and chin. So, we worked our artistry on him, addressing each area with all of our skill and expertise in order to enhance his already great features. We widened his chin, accentuated the angle of his jawline, sharpened his cheeks, and subtly filled his under-eyes, leaving him more than satisfied with the results.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Naked Sundays today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Homosalate, Octisalate, and Avobenzone
- It has a gel serum texture, lightweight dry touch feel
- No white cast on my skin tone¬†
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural radiant finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Doesn't sting my eyes
- Around 12 pumps to get the necessary amount needed for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- Around $25 for 30mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Target.
üîÜ
They said semi matte finish but I definitely didn't get that. It is quick drying and leaves a dry touch feel on the skin, but it definitely adds shine. Feels great though! Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Pores don‚Äôt open or close, and skincare isn‚Äôt one size fits all. Here‚Äôs how to get real about what your skin needs: üí°‚ú®

Oily skin? Look for lightweight, non-comedogenic hydration like gel moisturizers and niacinamide.

Dry skin? Your skin craves ceramides, rich moisturizers, and layers of hydration.

Acne-prone? Don‚Äôt skip SPF (seriously, it matters) and opt for calming ingredients like salicylic acid or azelaic acid.

Combo skin? Customize! A hydrating serum for your cheeks and a mattifying product for your T-zone can work wonders.

Understanding your skin type is the foundation of better results‚Ä¶and your skin will thank you for it. üåøüíï

If you haven‚Äôt tried the formula they are a classic pencil formula that‚Äôs half creamy, half grippy (but not in a waxy way.) They‚Äôre comfortable and easy to smudge, and they don‚Äôt set down the way, which I prefer.

If you want something super budge proof and transfer resistant, these are not for you. But if you‚Äôre like me and you prefer a more creamy lip liner that isn‚Äôt slippery, I think you‚Äôll love these.

Paint my number is described as a muted mauve but I‚Äôd describe it as a muted rose. It‚Äôs much warmer than what ‚Äúmuted mauve‚Äù would suggest, but I really like it. It goes beautifully with clear gloss, or all of my plum/berry lip glosses.

Work of art is one of my most used liners because it‚Äôs a chameleon. I swear it changes color! Sometimes it looks like a pinky taupe, which is how they describe it, and other times it looks like a warm beige-brown. It‚Äôs perfect for my nude lipsticks but it really seems to go with any gloss I put on top.

Overall, I adore this formula and I really hope Tower 28 continues to launch more shades!

Korean beauty (K-beauty) has taken the global beauty industry by storm, and one of its most iconic trends is the concept of ""glass skin."" Glass skin refers to a complexion that is incredibly smooth, luminous, and translucent, much like a piece of glass. Achieving this flawless, dewy look is the result of meticulous skincare routines designed to nourish, hydrate, and perfect the skin over time.

At the heart of glass skin is the idea of healthy, well-hydrated skin. It‚Äôs not just about masking imperfections or covering up with makeup. Instead, glass skin emphasizes the importance of achieving beauty from within, using a combination of skincare products and techniques that focus on long-term results. The goal is a clear, even-toned complexion that reflects light effortlessly, giving the face a radiant, almost ethereal glow.

The Key Components of a Glass Skin Routine

Achieving glass skin involves a comprehensive skincare regimen, with a focus on hydration, exfoliation, and protection. Here are some key steps:

1. **Double Cleansing**: The first step in the glass skin routine is the K-beauty staple of double cleansing. This process involves using an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, followed by a water-based cleanser to thoroughly clean the skin. Proper cleansing is crucial for preventing breakouts and ensuring that the skin is prepared to absorb subsequent skincare products.

2. **Exfoliation**: Regular exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, promoting smoother and brighter skin. Gentle exfoliants like AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes work to unclog pores and refine skin texture without causing irritation, which is important for maintaining the smooth, clear base necessary for glass skin.

3. **Toning**: Korean toners are designed to hydrate and balance the skin‚Äôs pH, as well as prepare it to absorb serums and moisturizers. Hydrating toners, often infused with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water, deliver essential moisture to the skin, making it appear plump and fresh.

4. **Essences and Serums**: Essences are lightweight, hydrating liquids that help boost the skin‚Äôs moisture levels. Serums, on the other hand, are more concentrated and are used to target specific skin concerns such as hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or dullness. Layering these products is key to achieving the deep hydration that gives glass skin its signature reflective quality.

5. **Moisturizing**: A rich, hydrating moisturizer seals in all the previous layers of hydration. Look for moisturizers with humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which draw moisture into the skin, as well as emollients like ceramides and fatty acids to strengthen the skin barrier and lock in moisture.

6. **Sunscreen**: The final step, and perhaps the most important, is applying sunscreen. UV protection is critical to prevent sun damage, which can lead to premature aging and dull skin. Korean sunscreens are often lightweight and formulated to leave the skin looking dewy, adding to the overall glow.

Why Is Glass Skin So Popular?

The appeal of glass skin lies in its emphasis on natural beauty. Unlike makeup-heavy trends, it focuses on achieving a healthy, radiant complexion that doesn‚Äôt rely on cosmetics for coverage. Instead, it encourages a holistic approach to skincare that prioritizes hydration, nourishment, and protection. Moreover, the glow achieved with glass skin makes the face appear youthful, fresh, and vibrant ‚Äî qualities that are universally desired.

Ultimately, glass skin is more than just a trend; it‚Äôs a lifestyle that promotes skincare as a form of self-care, teaching individuals to appreciate the beauty of healthy, well-maintained skin.

However, with the help of HD Lipo and a tummy tuck, we were able to tighten up that skin and give him the flat stomach he had been working so hard for! Another concern of his was the laxity he had in his chest, which was any easy fix with the help of a nipple lift + gland removal. This combination was crucial for achieving that broad and athletic chest he was after. His results? Nothing short of perfection! He is loving his newly defined and sculpted body.

Don't believe the myth that hitting the gym alone can fix loose skin - sometimes you need a little extra help to get the results you want.

RECOVERY
10-14 days after surgery. Back to the gym in 3-4 weeks.

POST-CARE
His healing was expedited with our surgical post care protocol in our office consisting of lymphatic massage, IV NAD+, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. After care is essential for achieving the best results possible.

I tried this a few months ago but put it down because I thought it was just okay. It wasn't giving me the long-lasting mattifying effect I expected from the product. But a recent breakout gave me a much great appreciation for it. That bit of Salicylic Acid was doing a great job on subtlety clear my breakout without being too aggressive.

üî¥ Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!


I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

He always envisioned having washboard abs and a bulky, broad chest, but was being held back by problem areas of fat. He was scrolling social media one day and found our account. After viewing our many gladiator lipo results, he was blown away and decided he wanted to be our next gladiator.  So, we gave him exactly what he was after. Not only did we give him gladiator lipo, with fat grafting to his shoulders, chest, and buttocks, but we also did some Bodytite to tighten his thighs. He also received gland removal and a nipple lift to balance out that chest. By the time he was all healed up, he was completely in love with his results and considers it to be one of the best decisions he has ever made.

MORE THAN JUST A PROCEDURE
The gladiator procedure itself is extremely important to getting our patient's body to where he wanted it to be, but it isn't 100% of the journey. Post-procedure, our patient stepped into our after-care protocol, complete with IV therapy, hyperbaric therapy, lymphatic massages, and PEPTIDES such as MK-677 for muscle gain.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Hyper Skin today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a milky fluid texture, goes on a little grippy
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural radiant finish
- No added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $36 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or Sephora.
üîÜ
The color kinda through me off, because it look like a tinted sunscreen but it is indeed a chemical sunscreen. It has brightening ingredients like the rest of Hyper Skin products, so I knew it would give a nice glowy finish on the skin. As the name suggests, it's a great daily invisible for all sunscreen. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

I bought this limited edition eyeshadow a while ago from Kose Visee, a Japanese makeup brand that is popular in Asia. üáØüáµ It contains matte and shimmery eyeshadows, with blush and contour powder so it has become my go-to palette, and I am glad that I can finally show you the colors on this GRWM reel ü•∞

üòç Most Japanese makeup palettes come with clear how-to instructions on the back. To be honest with you, I seldom follow the instructions but this time around, I follow almost every single step and I like the easy, natural result. I skip the eyeliner as the deep blue eyeshadow with a grey undertone is good enough to deepen my eyes but mascara is a must in this natural look.

üíï What is your go-to makeup palette? üíï

One of my favorites from Comune is Essentials Face Cleanser, and Comune is a US clean skincare brand that manufactures its products in Korea, catering to both men and women. üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®

Formulated with ü•¨ superfood extracts and antioxidants, this cleanser effectively removes skin impurities and light makeup, leaving my skin clean and smooth. üçÉ

The Comune Essentials Face Cleanser comes in a watery gel foam that can be used day and night without drying the skin. It eliminates dirt and excessive sebum and prevents clogged pores while maintaining the skin‚Äôs pH balance for gentle yet effective cleansing.

Key Ingredients:

üçµ Green Tea - A natural antioxidant that protects the skin from oxidative damage caused by free radicals and offers restorative properties to reduce premature aging.

üåø Parsley - Rich in vitamins and essential minerals for soothing the skin.

ü•¨ Spinach and Kale - A superfood complex that nourishes and restores the skin.

üíô Blue Agave - A resilient desert plant containing high amounts of fructans, vitamins, and essential amino acids for anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits.

ü•∞ My thoughts on Comune Essentials Face Cleanser:

‚ù§Ô∏è I absolutely love it! As you can see, I‚Äôve already used half of it. It effectively cleans my skin without stripping its natural moisture. It‚Äôs gentle, and I haven‚Äôt experienced any sensitivity issues while using it.

üëè The texture of the cleanser is neither too watery nor too thick; it‚Äôs a watery-gel texture with a subtle medicinal scent, which I‚Äôm not crazy about but don‚Äôt mind either. It foams easily when applied to wet skin and leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, and soft afterward. However, I don‚Äôt use it as a makeup remover since I prefer using a cleansing oil for removing waterproof eye makeup. üëÄ",Superfood for Your Skin-Comune Essentials Face Cleanser #glowingskin #facecleaning #acne #acnescars,21.0,0.04411764705882353,14,2024-05-31T07:05:51.000Z,4,False,0,1,0.006289308176100629,0.13636363636363635,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I use it after serums and layer with sunscreen for skin protection. I also use it after sunbathing and it goes with the Jumiso snail mucin essence perfectly. This duo is a must have in Summer as they are great for every skin type, even for oily and acne skin ‚ò∫Ô∏è

üß™ Key Ingredients of VT Collagen Reedle Shot 100:

‚ú®Intense hydration for a plump, dewy glow

ü™ΩLightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no sticky residue!

üåà My Experience:
A huge thank you to StyleKorean @stylekorean_global for sending me the Radiance Recover Box, which includes the VT Collagen Reedle Shot 100! I‚Äôm thrilled to try this product, especially since it‚Äôs the 100 variant - not too strong like the 300 or 700 options.

When I first tried it, I used it during the day for a reel (it is supposed to use at night right after cleansing), and I loved how refreshing it felt!

The texture is a milky lotion that absorbs quickly without any tackiness. I barely felt any tingling, which is a nice change from the stronger versions!

I massage it in with a gentle patting motion to minimize irritation. After it absorbs, I follow up with my daily moisturizer and sunscreen to protect my skin.

Have you tried the VT Collagen Reedle Shot 100? Let me know your thoughts! üí¨üëá

Thanks to @tfit.global for sending me this makeup primer for review. I‚Äôve been using it for almost 2 weeks and I LOVE it!

Product Claims:

üå∏ Pore-Blurring Magic: Say goodbye to visible pores and hello to a smooth, airbrushed finish! This primer instantly minimizes pores, fine lines, and uneven texture for the perfect base.

üåü Smooth & Lightweight: The product has a silky, lightweight texture that feels like a second skin. It‚Äôs breathable without any greasiness.

üíñ Brighten with Pink Tint: The delicate pink tint enhances your skin complexion.

üí¶ Water & Sweat Proof: Stay flawless all day long! This primer is resistant to water and sweat, keeping makeup intact in any condition.

üíÑ 12-Hour Freshness: Lock in your makeup for up to 12 hours without smudging or caking. Keep your makeup looking fresh and flawless all day.

What do I think about it?

‚úÖ It doesn‚Äôt break me out or create a rubbery residue when I apply face powder or foundation on top of it.

‚úÖ It blurs my pores and makes them less visible.

‚úÖ The pink tint is a plus as it brightens my yellowish skin complexion, just as the product claims.

‚úÖ It doesn‚Äôt burn my eyes.

I live in Hong Kong, so the weather is hot üî• and humid üí¶. Under these conditions, I don‚Äôt think this primer can keep my makeup fresh for 12 hours, as my sebum and sweat oxidize the foundation and probably the makeup primer. My skin complexion turns ‚Äúyellow‚Äù again, closer to my natural skin tone after a few hours.

It‚Äôs not a typical makeup base that glides on the skin easily ‚Äî I have to squeeze the tube harder to get the product, then tug at my skin and use my fingers to apply the primer upward. These don‚Äôt bother me at all. In fact, this formula is better than a typical spreadable makeup base, which tends to melt and create residues when I put on foundation or touch up during the day.

NYX is one of my favorite drugstore brands! I love using their Soft Matte Lip Cream and Epic Ink Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner, so I couldn‚Äôt resist trying NYX Fat Oil Lip! üíã I should have bought it years ago, but I was obsessed with K-Beauty lippies, so I only recently decided to give it a try. üòÖ

üíã NYX Fat Oil Lip Drip is still one of their best-selling products, and I can see why. It‚Äôs a dewy, juicy, and hydrating lip gloss that can be used alone or with other lip products. I prefer non-lip-plumping glosses, and Fat Oil Lip Drip fits the bill. It‚Äôs as sticky as other lip oils but not goopy, which I appreciate.

I bought the shades Supermodel (pink) and Newsfeed (red), which beautifully complement my yellowish skin tone. The product also contains üçì Raspberry Oil, üçì Cloudberry Oil, and üùÜ Vegan Squalane, which help retain moisture in my lips.

üßê However, remember that Fat Oil Lip Drip isn‚Äôt a lip tint, so you‚Äôll need to reapply it after eating, and you may want to use lipstick or lip liner for more intense lip colors.

Have you tried NYX Fat Oil Lip Drip yet?

Now in his mid-thirties, he was determined to look in the mirror and see the person he felt inside‚Äîa confident, fit, and defined version of himself.

For him, it wasn‚Äôt just about appearances; it was about reconnecting with that athletic past that had once been a huge part of his identity. Though age had brought some stubborn pockets of fat and loose skin, he was ready to make the change and fully invest in himself. He imagined a physique that would reflect his drive and bring back the confidence that had always fueled his goals.

The journey back to his best self was all about intention and commitment. He was focused on rediscovering his true form, and the results have been transformative. The change isn‚Äôt only physical‚Äîhe‚Äôs walking away with renewed confidence, carrying himself with a sense of pride that reminds him of the prime years he enjoyed as an athlete. It‚Äôs incredible to see how achieving the right look can reconnect someone to who they‚Äôve always been at heart.

As his doctor, I feel incredibly grateful to play a part in journeys like these. There‚Äôs something deeply rewarding about helping someone rediscover themselves and seeing how transformative changes spark newfound confidence and joy in my patients. Knowing that my work gives them the chance to live in a body that reflects who they feel they are‚Äîthat‚Äôs what I love most about what I do.

This patient came to me because her acne scars had taken a toll on her self-esteem for years. She felt like no matter how much she improved other aspects of her appearance, those scars kept her from feeling like her best self. After some research, she decided it was time to take control and begin her journey toward smooth, radiant skin.

This was her second treatment, part of a carefully customized plan I created to target her scars from every angle. Acne scars often require multiple sessions to see dramatic improvement, but with each treatment, I‚Äôm building progress and getting her closer to her ultimate skin goals. For her, I used a combination approach:
‚ú® Bellafill injections to stimulate long-term collagen production and fill in areas of volume loss.
‚ú® TCA cross to target deep, stubborn icepick scars with precision.
‚ú® Halo laser to gently resurface the skin and address tone and texture.
‚ú® CO2 laser for deeper resurfacing, tackling scars at their core and promoting significant collagen remodeling.

Each of these treatments works in synergy to create smoother, more even skin over time. While acne scars don‚Äôt fade overnight, a tailored plan like this ensures I‚Äôm making meaningful, lasting changes with every session.

She‚Äôs already thrilled with the results she‚Äôs seeing, but what excites her most is how this journey has made her feel. For the first time in years, she‚Äôs starting to look in the mirror and feel confident. She‚Äôs no longer hiding her skin with makeup or avoiding photos‚Äîshe‚Äôs embracing the changes and feeling more like herself again.

If acne scars are holding you back, there‚Äôs no reason to wait. With modern treatments and a personalized approach, clear, smooth skin is within reach. Send me a DM today to learn more about how I can create a plan just for you!

To go the extra mile, we added the smallest amount of filler to her brow area to accentuate her eyes even more- leaving them looking more awake. As she naturally has great structure, we only gave her slight enhancements to her chin and softened the nasolabial folds. By diligently injecting filler to her chin, we created balance among her features as well as crafting that beautiful heart shaped look. She is absolutely loving her results and how refreshed she looks.

I just bought this adorable Beauty of Joseon Glow Charging Rice Duo Set at YesStyle and I love how it cleans and brightens my skin! üåü This duo set includes the BOJ Glow Replenishing Rice Milk, the Ground Rice and Honey Glow Mask, and a cute headband. üß¥üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

What is BOJ Glow Replenishing Rice Milk?
This rice toner offers rich nutrients to all skin types, creating a smooth and radiant complexion. üåæ‚ú® Formulated with Rice Extract & Rice Amino Acids for antioxidant and moisturizing effects. It features a unique dual-layer formula with a moisture layer and a powder layer to control sebum production, offering extra care to pores.üíß

My Experience:
‚ú® This toner has a lightweight, dual-layer formula and watery texture with sebum powder, so shake it well before using. The powder layer of this toner absorbs oil effectively, making it more suitable for oily, and combo to oily skin rather than dry and sensitive skin as the product claims. üåü This doesn‚Äôt mean I had a negative reaction to it, but I did feel my skin was a bit tight after using this toner so I would apply a serum and moisturizer in no time.

What is BOJ Ground Rice and Honey Glow Mask?
It‚Äôs an all-in-one wash-off mask that helps to clean and create a radiant look. üçØ‚ú® Enriched with natural Rice Hull Powder & Honey to provide deep hydration while soothing inflammatory skin conditions. It offers benefits like brightening, scrubbing, and boosting skin elasticity for youthful skin in one step. üåü

How to use?
After cleansing, use toner to rehydrate the skin. üí¶ Then, apply an even layer of the mask onto the skin and leave it for 15-20 mins. I massage the sides of my nose before rinsing it off with lukewarm water which helps to remove blackheads and my pores look smaller afterward. üßπ

My Experience:
üòç It effectively cleans up my blackheads, and my skin feels soft and looks radiant! The scrub in the mask is refined, making it gentle on my skin.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this tinted mineral sunscreen from Colorescience today! I am using the Deep tint.
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Zinc oxide
- It has a liquid fluid texture
- Leaves a visible cast on my skin tone due to the amount of coverage it has
- Will show in my facial hair
- Has a natural finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Doesn't sting my eyes
- Water/sweat resistant
- Around $54 for 55mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Dermstore.
üîÜ
If you need to be using a mineral sunscreen and you are a little bit lighter than me, you can check this one out. But this is not for me. Has some good qualities to it, high protection, the benefits of the iron oxides, and water resistant. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

2471,26.0,False,386.0,89900.0,"I bought the Refy Summer Color Lip and Cheek Collection in the shade Papaya at Sephora:

Color:
The blush looks more red-orange on me, which is what I was hoping for. The lip gloss and lip blush are more of a neon orange.

Scent:
All of these are fragrance free

Cream Blush:
A stiff, balm formula. I like that it doesn‚Äôt have a dewy finish but I found it very difficult to blend. It looked a little patchy on my cheeks, but I do appreciate that it‚Äôs on the more long-wearing side.

Lip Blush:
A comfortable matte lip balm that blurs the lips. Unfortunately, this smells pretty strongly of pennies and I don‚Äôt like the round bullet shape because my lips are thinner than the shape/size of the bullet. Would‚Äôve liked this more in a proper lipstick shape so I can get a more precise line on my sharp cupid‚Äôs bow.

Tinted Lip Gloss:
Thin, oily, and runny. Given it‚Äôs so bright and pigmented, this gets way too messy. The squeezey tube also contributes to the mess - because it‚Äôs such a thin formula, I accidentally squeeze too much out every time.

Summary:
The Papaya and Guava colors are SO fun and I really like seeing brands launch some near-neon shades. It was a refreshing change of pace! That said, I think these formulas are underwhelming. That said, I am very picky so if you aren‚Äôt as discerning as I am, you may love this collection!

2588,0.0,True,18.0,319000.0,"Collagen loss and DEEP scars? Let's talk about the treatment that actually WORKS! 

When it comes to deep, stubborn scars‚Äîespecially stellate pseudoscars‚Äîyou need more than just a basic laser treatment. These scars run deep and wide, making them some of the most challenging to treat. That‚Äôs why I take an aggressive, multi-layered approach to completely transform the skin‚Äîtargeting every layer for real, lasting improvement.

One of the biggest game-changers in this patient‚Äôs treatment? Silicone Microdroplets‚Äîa PERMANENT filler that not only lifts scars but stimulates collagen production for long-term improvement. Unlike other fillers like Bellafill, silicone is more cost-effective while still delivering incredible, lasting results. Over time, it integrates seamlessly into the skin, restoring lost volume and creating a smoother, more even texture.

Here‚Äôs the power-packed combination I used:
‚úîÔ∏è Silicone Microdroplets ‚Äì The ultimate scar-filling and collagen-boosting powerhouse! Unlike temporary fillers, silicone permanently plumps depressed scars, restores volume, and actively improves skin structure over time. 
‚úîÔ∏è Deep FX CO2 Laser ‚Äì Stellate pseudoscars run deep, so a superficial laser wasn‚Äôt enough. This penetrates deep into scar tissue, breaking up tough fibrotic bands and triggering intensive skin regeneration for true resurfacing.
‚úîÔ∏è Active FX CO2 Laser ‚Äì A more controlled, resurfacing pass to refine the skin‚Äôs top layer, improving texture, clarity, and overall smoothness.
‚úîÔ∏è Halo Laser ‚Äì This dual-wavelength laser treats at two levels, addressing both surface irregularities and deep damage to create a smoother, more even complexion.
‚úîÔ∏è Pix E Microneedling RF ‚Äì This radiofrequency-powered microneedlingtightens skin, smooths out irregularities, and boosts collagen from the inside out, making scars less visible over time.

You don‚Äôt need to spend a fortune for healthy, glowing skin! ‚ú® I‚Äôve got 5 easy skincare tips using things you already have at home. ‚§µÔ∏è

Facial Steaming with Herbal Tea üßñüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Use a bowl of hot water and add a few herbal tea bags like chamomile or green tea. Lean over the bowl with a towel over your head to trap the steam. This helps open up pores, allowing the antioxidants from the tea to nourish your skin, while also relaxing and detoxifying.

Rice Water Toner üçö

Save the water you rinse your rice in (make sure it‚Äôs clean!) and use it as a toner. Rice water is rich in vitamins and minerals that help brighten the skin, reduce dark spots, and tighten pores. Store it in a spray bottle and keep it in the fridge for up to a week.

DIY Honey and Turmeric Spot Treatment üçØ

Mix a tiny amount of turmeric with honey to create a natural spot treatment. Apply it to acne spots or scars and leave it on for 10-15 minutes. The anti-inflammatory properties of turmeric combined with the healing properties of honey can help reduce redness and speed up healing.

Aloe Vera and Cucumber Ice Cubes üßä

Blend aloe vera gel and cucumber juice, pour the mixture into an ice cube tray, and freeze. Rub a cube on your face in the morning to reduce puffiness, soothe irritation, and refresh your skin. The cooling effect also helps to tighten pores.

Overnight Green Tea Mist üåø

Brew a cup of green tea and let it cool completely. Pour it into a spray bottle and keep it in the fridge. Use it as a refreshing facial mist before bed. Green tea is packed with antioxidants, which help repair and rejuvenate the skin overnight.

Gentle reminder that skincare is not a one size fits all so depending on your skin type and your skin needs some of these tips may or may not work for you, but now you have some at home budget friendly options  that are practical and easy!

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from BGS today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a cream texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural radiant finish
- No added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Water and sweat resistant
- Around $19 for 89mL. Can be purchased from their website.
üîÜ
This says men, but anyone can use this. There is marketing, but it's just sunscreen at the end of the day. But this one is new, and the formula is slightly different. I think I like this one more. Wish it was SPF 50 like the BGS Kids version, but this is still a win for me. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Thanks to @axisy_official for sending me the Glass Skin Duo - Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum and Vegan Collagen Eye Serum for review.

Today, I am going to review the üëÄ Vegan Collagen Eye Serum, which is part of the AXIS-Y 6+1+1 series.

‚úÖ Each product from this series is formulated with a combination of 6 nutrient-rich base ingredients, 1 core goal-oriented ingredient, and 1 quality-producing effective technology.

‚ù§Ô∏è What do I think about AXIS-Y Vegan Collagen Eye Serum?

üåø AXIS-Y Vegan Collagen Eye Serum is designed for eye wrinkles, puffiness, and dark circles. I have been using it day and night for about a week, and what I love is its hydrating, soothing, and calming effects. The ingredients in the eye serum are so gentle that I can layer the product with Retinol or other eye creams if I want to.

ü•∞ I love storing the eye cream in the fridge for an ultimate cooling effect that helps to reduce eye puffiness and dark circles. I press the pump once and apply the serum in a circular motion with slight pressure at the inner corners of my eyes to boost blood circulation. üòå The whole process is calming and helps relieve eye fatigue. üòä

The product claims that it will improve wrinkles in 2 weeks, so I am excited to see significant results later.

üîë AXIS-Y Vegan Collagen Eye Serum contains:

6 Basic Ingredients:
- Triple Hyaluronic Acid - for moisture retention
- Jojoba Seed Oil - for skin moisturization
- Green Plum - for skin vitality
- Sunflower Seed Oil - for balancing oil & water levels
- Green Apple - for clear skin
- Green Grape - for antioxidant properties

1 Core Ingredient:
Vegan Collagen - for reducing wrinkles and improving skin elasticity

1 Effective Ingredient:
5-Peptide Complex - for skin firmness and reducing the appearance of wrinkles

Will you try AXIS-Y Vegan Collagen Eye Serum? üåüüëÄ

The next installment of me catching up on all the Prequel launches here. I've been thoroughly surprised by this new Prequel Vitamin C Serum! It seems comparable to the vitamin c serums I usually like. I've been using it for a few weeks, so I'll have to see how it goes until I finish it. But it hasn't caused me any irritation.

Main thing I like so far is that it is only $23, which is a pretty good price for a Vitamin C Serum of this caliber. It is a blend of L-ascorbic acid, ferulic acid, ergothioneine, niacinamide and inulin. Has a thin watery texture and that signature Vitamin C Serum smell lol. If you've tried it already, let me know what you think!

üåô‚ú® What is it?
The @esteelauder Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Overnight Treatment is an intensive nighttime formula designed to deeply nourish your skin while you sleep. It works overnight to restore moisture, improve texture, and leave your skin looking healthier and more radiant by morning.

üåø Key Ingredients:
This luxurious treatment is packed with potent ingredients like Chronolux‚Ñ¢ S.O.S. technology and powerful antioxidants that target fine lines, dehydration, and visible signs of aging.

Hyaluronic Acid and anti-pollution protection help to lock in moisture and shield your skin from environmental stressors.

üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Skincare Benefits:
- Smooths fine lines and wrinkles
- Boosts hydration for plumper skin
- Restores radiance and glow
- Helps your skin recover from daily stressors

üåü My Experience:
Thanks to my dearest friend Kelly for spoiling me with this luxurious night treatment! The texture of the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Overnight Treatment feels like a beauty balm but melts into the skin instantly.

After applying, I gently massage and pat it in, which helps improve the skin‚Äôs texture, softens fine lines, and gives me a beautiful glow. I even apply it around my sensitive eye area with no issues ‚Äî my fine lines are greatly improved! üôåüíñ

Will you try it? What is your favorite night treatment?

üçÄ Formulated with 72% CICA (Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract), this gel is a true powerhouse in calming and soothing irritated skin. Used for over 3,000 years in India, the Americas, and China, CICA is used for protecting the skin from external irritants.

üçÄ Packed with INFLAX, a soothing blend of Persimmon leaf, Licorice, Opuntia Coccinellifera, Morus Alba Bark Extract, and Tea Tree Leaf Oil which has long been recognized for its strong properties for reducing skin redness. üçÉ

My Experience:
ü•∞ I have a combination skin with some redness, and this lightweight gel works wonders for me. After applying toner and essence, I gently pat a thin layer onto the affected areas. It absorbs beautifully without leaving any greasy residue. üåø The Tea Tree Leaf Oil scent is subtle, and it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all ‚Äî just a hint of freshness! üçµ

ü•∞ This gel spreads easily, is gentle on the skin, and keeps my skin hydrated without any dryness. Plus, no irritation around the eyes! üëå When layering sunscreen and makeup, I use a patting motion to avoid any rubbery residue.

Overall, I love the AC Clear Cica Gel‚Äôs calming effects and lightweight feel. üòâ Remember to use it on troubled areas ONLY where you tend to have redness and acne.

‚õîÔ∏è For those with dry & sensitive skin, you might use the Cica Cream and The Plant Base Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid instead. The Cica Gel contains alcohol (as the 3rd ingredient), which doesn‚Äôt irritate me but might be a concern for sensitive skin, despite its calming formulation.

Have you tried THE PLANT BASE AC Clear Cica Gel? üíö

This incredible patient came to me unhappy with his ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù and ready to make a change. Through Gladiator Lipo, he achieved a sculpted, athletic physique that completely redefined his look and boosted his confidence.

Gladiator Lipo isn‚Äôt just about removing fat‚Äîit‚Äôs about artistry and precision. Most of my patients aren't fat--they just have problem areas that need addressing and definition that needs to be brought out. This patient was no different! My goal was to shape him in a way that gave him almost immediate athletic contour. 

This journey is truly inspiring! Taking control of your body and your life is no small feat, but this patient did just that. By hitting the gym as hard as he could, dieting, and taking PEPTIDES, he has taken his results to a whole different level. Now, he feels confident, empowered, and proud of the way he looks‚Äîand he loves showing off his new physique!

I‚Äôm all about helping you achieve the BEST version of yourself, whether that‚Äôs through Gladiator Lipo or any other transformative procedure. This isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all approach; every treatment is customized to YOUR goals and I provide unmatched artistry through body contouring to help you achieve your vision.

I like warming this up between my fingers to facilitate the application process. No More Baggage can be applied over your favorite eye cream and be worn under makeup. 
I love that it tightens the eye contours! My favorite way to use is during the day under makeup. It does not interfere or alter the performance of my makeup, no matter how long my day is!

Our patient today is a model, so naturally she wants to look her best on and off camera. She's noticed her skin has been dry, so to fix this she came in for one of our newest treatments: Skinvive. Consisting of hyaluronic acid, Skinvive has a gel-like texture and targets the skin on a superficial level. This treatment can be used in various ways: as a micro needling treatment, in between laser treatments, as a combo treatment with a facial, to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and to hydrate the skin making it glow more than ever. One of the many reasons patients love this treatment is due to the minimal downtime, a couple days of healing for 6 months of glowing, hydrated skin- that's a no brainer. After the procedure she was a bit swollen but she is loving how radiant and smooth her skin is looking!

2969,20.0,False,512.0,89900.0,"Nature Republic sent me two new shades of my favorite lip product ever - the honey melting lip balms. The two new shades have a glitter finish, which is new for their lineup.

Scent: apricot (one of my favorite scents)
Price: $9.80
Finish: high shine, glossy, smoothing
Texture: thick, cushiony, slightly stiff but then melts on contact, slightly tacky/grippy. (Aka my favorite texture)

I personally prefer the honey melting lips that are opaque and have more base pigment (shades 1‚Äì5.)

Shades 5-10 were also shimmer-free but were more sheer than the first five.

They also launch two plumping/cooling shades in a black and a link, which I haven‚Äôt tried.

Overall I LOVE THESE but the glitter ones are a tad gritty so I don‚Äôt see myself reaching for them.

My suggestions: I would LOVE to see a light peachy pink, a collection of nudes for all skin tones, a cool pink, a hot pink, a bright orangey-red, and a ‚Äúmy lips but better‚Äù plum. Because obviously I need them in every color under the sun. üòÇ

These aren't available on YesStyle US yet, but they are on Amazon https://rstyle.me/+Rot6-MOsDf6e9EMvgymfQQ

You may not have heard of BIOHEAL BOH, but it‚Äôs an Olive Young award-winning trend product‚Äîand now I know why! üèÜ I picked up the BIOHEAL BOH Probioderm Collagen Remodeling Serum Set for about $20 USD üò≤. This set includes:
üíß 2x 30ml Serums (original + refill)
üå∏ 1x 20ml Cream

On Amazon, just the serum alone costs almost $34, so this deal is a STEAL! üõçÔ∏è

Product Features: 

üå∏ The serum: 
For pore-tightening & firming: The serum tightens pores and smooths skin for a more youthful look.

Collagen power: Packed with 45,000 capsules of 4 types of collagen + elastin for elasticity and firmness.

Light & hydrating: Non-sticky formula perfect for all skin types‚Äîeven oily or sensitive skin.

üå∏ The Cream:
Infused with 150,000 collagen capsules and Probioderm, a patented probiotic blend, this lightweight cream enhances elasticity and hydration for smoother, bouncier skin. Plus, it has a subtle floral scent that feels like a spa experience!

‚ú® Who‚Äôs it for?
The texture of this duo is great for oily and combo to oily skin. If you‚Äôre battling visible pores, fine lines, or sagging skin, this duo is your secret weapon. Use it nightly for glowing, firm skin!

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These products contain fragrance, but I find the scent refreshing and non-overwhelming. 

Tips: Let the products fully absorb before applying makeup. I prefer using them at night as my morning routine is too rushed.

In addition to this set, I also grabbed some other goodies: Rom&nd lip gloss, Anua serums, Heimish eye cream, and Maybelline mascaras‚Äîstay tuned for more reviews! üòç

üìå Out of stock on Olive Young Global, but you can still snag the serum on Amazon (though it‚Äôs nearly double the price!).

3339,5.0,False,210.0,89900.0,"Thrive just launched their EmpowerMattePrecision Lipstick Crayon and they sent me most of the shades! These are $28 and are supposed to be a lip liner and bold matte lipstick in one. 

They describe the formula as a ‚Äúweightless comfort-matte with a velvety-smooth texture that glides on tug-free for even color and a non-sticky finish. Infused with moisturizing ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, and sodium hyaluronate, this game-changing matte lipstick nourishes + hydrates lips and remains comfortable to wear all day.‚Äù

My thoughts:
These are probably the most lightweight bold lipstick I‚Äôve tried. They feel ultra-thin and a bit slippery, which might be a good thing depending on your preference. They‚Äôre definitely comfortable, I didn‚Äôt notice my lips feeling particularly dry, but I think there‚Äôs bit too much glide to the formula, they can definitely transfer and get messy. 

Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable wearing such a slippery formula in bold colors, but I also don‚Äôt like lipstick crayons in general because they feel quite young/cheap so this product just isn‚Äôt for me. I shipped these to a lovely follower so she could enjoy them instead! While these don‚Äôt align with my preferences for lipstick, I could see them being someone else‚Äôs favorite if you love ultra-lightweight formulas in a crayon component.

If your preferences usually align with mine, check out Thrive‚Äôs lip liners and lip gloss formulas! They‚Äôre some of my favorite products.

Will you choose The Valentino Rosso Valentino Refillable Lipstick?

She slept peacefully throughout the entire process, allowing me to focus on delivering dramatic yet natural results without any discomfort for her. Here's how I approached her comprehensive treatment:

‚úÖ InstaLift Threads: I started by gently lifting and repositioning sagging skin to create a more refreshed and youthful contour.
‚úÖ @miracucPDOthreads: To further enhance her mid and lower face, I used PDO threads, precisely sculpting and fixing tissue to achieve maximum definition.
‚úÖ Meshfill: For additional firmness and support, I targeted skin laxity with Meshfill, ensuring her results were smooth and sculpted.
‚úÖ BBL HERO Laser: Next, I reduced signs of aging, pigmentation, and age spots across her face, neck, arms, and chest, laying the foundation for a more even skin tone.
‚úÖ Pixel8 RF: Using advanced microneedling and radiofrequency, I evened out her complexion and refined her skin texture.
‚úÖ Halo Hybrid Laser: To address both surface and deeper layers of her skin, I performed a Halo treatment, significantly reducing pores, fine lines, and wrinkles.
‚úÖ CO2 Resurfacing: I finished with my most powerful laser to tighten her skin and erase fine lines, achieving a beautifully smooth and rejuvenated look.

Though she experienced some initial swelling and redness, her recovery was quick and seamless. Now, her skin is glowing, smooth, and incredibly youthful. She‚Äôs overjoyed with her results, and it‚Äôs moments like these that truly highlight the impact of expert care and advanced technology!

I‚Äôve tried both rom&nd Glasting Water Gloss in Sanho Crush (sheer orange) and Meteor Track (transparent) on my bare lips and ‚Äúboring‚Äù lipsticks. The results are impressive! üòç

Both lip glosses are transparent with tiny particles which give my lips a shiny and reflective layer ü™ûwithout greasiness. They also contain Sweet Almond and Anemarrhena Asphodeloides Root Extracts for moisturizing and soothing. I can feel that my lips are softer without lip lines, and my boring lipsticks look more interesting with subtle shiny result üíï

üôå Hands down to these goodies and they become part of my makeup necessities. üíã

Thanks to @stylevana_sv for sending me this Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Cream (and other goodies) which I longed to try, along with my self-purchased item, Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen, which has become a skincare staple in Summer.

ü§ó Use my code INF10KATUSA and shop at @stylevana_sv for 10-15% off! (Links in Profile)

üíô What is Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Cream?

It contains Birch Tree Sap that nourishes the skin by decreasing inflammation, purifying the skin, and hydrating with its extensive minerals, enzymes, proteins, and antioxidants.

Active Ingredients:
* Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice (10,000ppm): Reduces inflammation, purifies, and hydrates the skin with 17 amino acids, minerals, antioxidants, and vitamins.

* Panthenol: Enhances hydration.

üíô What do I think about Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Cream?

I‚Äôve been using this moisturizer for about a week, and I love it! It‚Äôs not a magical face cream that minimizes pores or brightens the skin in a flash, but it is a good, basic, hydrating moisturizer that calms and nourishes my combo to dry skin. üíß

I like the gel-creamy texture that feels weightless, and the cream sinks into my skin quickly. I can layer sunscreen and makeup afterward without creating rubbery residues or feeling heavy.

The formulation is mild, and the cream is unscented. It calms my hormonal acne, and my sebum production is under control.

This cream is designed for all skin types, even sensitive skin. However, if you have very dry skin, an essence or an ampoule is recommended for better moisturizing.

I apply Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen after the moisturizer, and the sunscreen glides on the skin effortlessly. The lotion texture of the Round Lab sunscreen is so light and runny. It has become my go-to sunscreen in high-humidity weather! Great for oily to combo skin. üåû

üíô What is Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++?

- SPF 50+/PA++++
- Combines Birch Tree Sap which nourishes skin by decreasing inflammation
- Contains amino acids, minerals, and Birch Sap vitamins to protect the skin from drying and prevent loss of hydration.
- A hydrating sunscreen that does double duty as a moisturizer, for all skin types, especially oily and combination skin.

üíô What do I think about Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++? 

It is perfect for combo and oily skin. The texture is a milky lotion that goes smooth on my skin, even in areas with large pores, without feeling sticky or tuning my skin when I apply it. It isn't an oil-control sunscreen, but I do love using it as it balances my skin moisture. No white cast and is perfect to use as a makeup base. üíï

I was so fortunate to purchase products in support of ‚Ä™@glam4good612‚Ä¨ , an organization that truly understands the transformative power of beauty and self esteem. They work tirelessly to bring joy and confidence to those who need it most. It's more than just makeup or skincare; it's about feeling confident moving through a world that can sometimes feel scary. It's about feeling empowered to take on life‚Äôs hardest challenges. I believe that beauty can be a gift, and it's meant to be shared. And I‚Äôm so blessed to be able to partner with these amazing organizations and companies to do that.

Here‚Äôs how eVive works: this amazing device uses high-frequency sound waves to break down micro-plaque that can block blood flow, enhances circulation, and stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. This process revitalizes the tissue and helps your body heal naturally, leading to:

1. Enhanced sensitivity
2. Stronger, more reliable erections
3. Improved overall performance
This makes it an incredible option for treating erectile dysfunction--something NO GUY ever wants to deal with.

What makes eVive stand out is its simplicity and effectiveness. There are no needles, no surgery, and no downtime, making it an accessible and comfortable solution for men looking to take control of their intimate health.

Why stop there? Amplify Your Results with Additional MALE DOWN UNDER Treatments:

- Penis Filler: For men looking to enhance size, improve symmetry, or achieve a more defined look, fillers are an excellent addition to your treatment plan.
- P-Shot: This treatment harnesses the power of your body‚Äôs platelet-rich plasma to rejuvenate tissue, promote healing, and supercharge performance.
- Scrotox: By relaxing the muscles in the scrotum, Scrotox creates a smoother, more youthful appearance while allowing the scrotum to hang lower.

Take the First Step Today

There‚Äôs absolutely zero reason to delay. Your sexual health and confidence are key to living your best life, and it all starts with a simple consultation! Visit emermaleclinic.com to learn more about eVive and our other penile enhancement options!

This natural makeup look is proof you don‚Äôt need a million products to feel a little put together. I used a primer, under-eye brightening cream, moisturizing miracle balm, mascara, lip pencil, dewy lip gloss balm, and lip oil to create this fresh, glowy vibe.

The key is using products that hydrate and reflect light, like a great primer, so the focus stays on a healthy glow‚Ä¶not imperfections, which are perfectly fine too. ‚ú®

Our lovely patient is back for some maintenance facial sculpting. She is very beautiful, but has some areas she would like us to address- nothing a little bit of filler won't help. Her main concern is balancing her temples; we used a feathering technique to blend her temples while adding some volume as they were becoming hollow, plus we also elevated her brows making her eyes appear more open. We followed the temples with a bit of filler to the jowl area to achieve support, then targeted her nasolabial folds next leaving them softer and less visible. We saved the absolute best for last- her nose. Starting with a small amount of filler to her septum and working our way up the dorsum, we were able to completely transform her nose shape straightening it out. She is over the moon with her results and cannot get over how wonderful she looks!

3913,21.0,False,335.0,89900.0,"I purchased the new Gxve Beauty dewy plump collagen lip gel in bouquet the Sephora sale! Here‚Äôs my quick review:

This is not a lip gel like I was expecting. When I hear ‚Äúgel‚Äù I think Fitglow lip serums, make beauty lip serum, live tinted huegloss, etc - a cushiony, buttery smooth formula with some slip.

The Gxve Beauty dewy plump lip gel is not that at all. To me, it feels exactly like their bubble pop electric gold in different packaging, but with a smoothing quality.

It‚Äôs a VERY thick, quite sticky formula with a strong cake batter smell and an insanely impressive smoothing quality. So avoid these if you want a lightweight formula, but pick one up if you love thicker glosses that smooth lip lines.

The shade bouquet is really pretty but it‚Äôs not even close to what the pictures looked like on Sephora. I thought I was getting a bright pinky coral shade, but bouquet is a light milky pink. I think one of the darker shades would suit me best because bouquet leaves a bit of a white ring around my lips.

Overall, I don‚Äôt think the product fits the name but it‚Äôs fantastic if you like a thick, smoothing gloss.

üíß A big thanks to @theplantbase_official The Plant Base for sending me this Hyaluronic Acid Ampoule for review ‚Äî it couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time as I‚Äôm dealing with some acne issues.

What is it? ü§î
This ampoule contains just one ingredient‚Äî100% Sodium Hyaluronate! üåü It has smaller molecules than Hyaluronic Acid, allowing it to penetrate the skin‚Äôs top layer (the epidermis) and reach deeper layers for enhanced hydration. Meanwhile, Hyaluronic Acid‚Äôs larger molecules coat the skin and prevent water loss. üí¶

Because ‚ÄúHyaluronic Acid‚Äù is a more recognizable term, some companies (including The Plant Base) label products as containing Hyaluronic Acid when they actually contain Sodium Hyaluronate. üß¥

You can use this ampoule on its own after cleansing and toning, or layer it with other products. It delivers multiple skincare benefits‚Äîhydrating, revitalizing, and moisturizing. Plus, it‚Äôs vegan and free from artificial fragrances. üå±

ü•∞ My Experience:
I‚Äôve been dealing with some acne lately, so I‚Äôve been using Benzoyl Peroxide to target the affected areas. That means I need a hydrating essence to prevent the dryness and irritation that can come with it. This ampoule has been the perfect solution ‚Äî it softens and calms my skin without being too thick or too lightweight. It absorbs easily, glides on effortlessly, and pairs beautifully with other The Plant Base products (I‚Äôm currently using their Cica Gel and Cica Cream for blemish treatment). üåø

During the daytime, I skip moisturizer and just use this ampoule with sunscreen for protection. üåû It‚Äôs a simple yet effective routine that works great for my combination skin, especially in humid weather.

And did I mention the packaging? üéÅ It‚Äôs part of The Plant Base‚Äôs Green Package campaign, reducing plastic use by 60% with paper tubes! üåç‚ôªÔ∏è

I think you can see that after multiple layers, it fades significantly to the point where it just looks like a subtle blush of color. Womp womp :/ I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else have this problem!

I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

My patient visits me annually for my signature heart-shaped facial sculpting look- trusting only my expertise to keep her looking youthful, balanced, and sculpted. With these regular maintenance treatments, she continues to defy aging and maintain her timeless look. This time, she wanted to fine-tune key areas for a refreshed and defined appearance. 

Starting with her temples, I filled in hollowness to support her brows and create a more harmonious contour. Next, I enhanced her cheeks for a structured, sculpted look and added filler to her jawline to sharpen and define her natural 90¬∞ angle. And guess what guys? The chin is in! I added some subtle but much needed projection to complete the heart-shaped symmetry she desired.I used filler to address her brows, for added bone definition and lift, enhancing her overall facial balance. Finally, her lips‚Äîalready gorgeous‚Äîwere given a subtle plump for a soft, natural enhancement and a keyhole pout. 

The result is a stunning, refreshed appearance with precise sculpting that highlights her natural beauty while achieving her goals. This is exactly why she chose me. Other providers who are not as experienced cannot deliver these results and often leave their patients with that overdone look. It‚Äôs all about knowledge, meticulous planning, and technique. Each patient‚Äôs facial features vary so it is extremely important to go to a professional that takes the time to asses your features.

These are normally $22 and the website says:
‚ÄúDayMask Lip Balm‚Äôs advanced formula combines the power of peptides, squalane and hyaluronic acid to provide daily hydration and protection. Infused with blueberry, peach, & pomegranate extract to leave lips feeling soft, smooth, and nourished.‚Äù

Scent: apricot (but to me it smells extremely sour, not very fruity)

Texture: Thin and lightweight, very runny

It‚Äôs a bit too slippery and oily for me, so I think you‚Äôd like this lip balm if you prefer a thinner/runnier texture!

üçë Anua Peach 70 Niacin Serum is one of the best-selling items from Anua, and I‚Äôm glad that I finally got it! To be honest, I was hesitant to try it since I didn‚Äôt have a good experience with Anua Peach 77 Niacin Conditioning Milk, which caused breakouts after a week or two of application. ü•≤

However, the Anua Peach 70 Niacin Serum doesn‚Äôt disappoint. ü•∞ It lives up to its promise, delivering a noticeable boost in skin radiance. It contains Niacinamide and Peach Extracts that help unclog pores, and clear post-acne marks without drying out my skin. üôèüèª

‚úÖ Skincare Benefits of Anua Peach 70 Niacin Serum:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Blends with Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract (70%) and Niacinamide (5%) to improve skin tone.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Removes dead skin cells and helps tighten pores with Peach Yogurt Complex and Betaine Salicylate.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Combines Vitamin B12, three types of Hyaluronic Acid, and Desert Yeast Oil for light hydration and skin softness.

üßê What do I think about Anua Peach 70 Niacin Serum?

I haven‚Äôt used it long enough to see significant brightening results, but it did clear my post-acne marks and gave me an instant glow. ü©µ

üí¶ It provides light hydration to my combination and dry skin, and the lightweight gel-watery texture is suitable for all skin types.

üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è It is easy to spread and absorb but creates a slightly tacky finish, so I only use a small amount, and avoid üö´ Vitamin C and üö´ Retinol when using this serum, as my skin becomes more sensitive and tends to break out if I use too many active ingredients.

‚ù§Ô∏è Overall, I love this serum and will continue using it to see the full brightening results.

Have you tried this viral Anua Peach 70 Niacin Serum?

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from La Roche Posay today!¬†
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a thick fluid texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- A little bit of residue in my facial hair, but not too noticeable
- Has a radiant finish
- Has added fragrance
- Doesn't stings my eyes sometimes
- I didn't get pilling
- Around $35 for 40mL. Can be purchased from retailers like Target.

This was released with their new dark spot serum featuring their new ingredient melasyl that is supposed to be great for clearing dark spots. I do think it is pricey especially for the size. I think you can get better drugstore sunscreens for a cheaper price, and if you're going to it for the melasyl dark spot aspect, just splurge for the actual serum. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Pls ignore my red nose, allergies have been kicking my ass.

These are $26 each and the brand claims that they‚Äôre a hybrid between a powder blush and their silky touch highlighter.

My experience is that these are way too shimmery to be a blush, and way too pigmented to be a highlighter. They emphasize texture due to the metallic nature of the formula, so I‚Äôd recommend this to people who either have extremely smooth skin, or don‚Äôt mind the texture-emphasizing effect.

I also found the deepest shades extremely difficult to blend despite only applying a tiny bit, tapping off excess, and blending some on the back of my hand. It‚Äôs just not a formula I find flattering in any way.

I do have friends with great skin who tried this and the product looked really good on them, but on my acne prone skin‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a pass for me.

The last cheek swatch I showed was the blush in cheer layered over their liquid blush in hope, and that‚Äôs the most flattering way to wear it IMO - as a blush topper. I don‚Äôt personally see the value in purchasing a product solely to be a blush topper but we‚Äôre all different!

What do you think? Would you like these?

Finally, a lightweight Snail Mucin Essence that I can use in Summer without feeling viscous ü•≥ - I am talking about Jumiso Snail Mucin 95% + Peptide Essence üêå. This product combines:

‚ù§Ô∏è 95% of Snail Mucin to improve skin texture and rehydrate skin without clogging pores.

‚ù§Ô∏è Non-sticky texture for all skin types, even oily and acne-prone skin

‚ù§Ô∏è 5-Peptides for anti-aging and skin firmness

‚ù§Ô∏è Boosts healing of sun-damaged skin in only 4 weeks

‚ù§Ô∏è Get smoother, firmer, and healthier skin - Thanks to the Snail Mucin and Peptides, these ingredients strengthen the skin barrier, plump and reduce fine lines, and signs of aging.

üëç Did I say that it‚Äôs a fragrance-free product that can be layered with Vitamin C serums for skin brightening? I use it day and night with Jumiso All Day Vitamin Serums:

‚òÄÔ∏è Morning - After cleansing and toning, I use

1Ô∏è‚É£ Jumiso All Day Vitamin Pure C 5.5 Glow Serum, then

2Ô∏è‚É£ Jumiso Snail Mucin 95% + Peptide Essence, then

3Ô∏è‚É£ Jumiso Snail Mucin 88 + Peptide Facial Cream, and

4Ô∏è‚É£ Sunscreen.

I can feel that my skin is softer, smoother, and well-hydrated while I am traveling. I can‚Äôt help but touch my skin several times when I am writing this caption. Silly me ü§™ but I love how my skin feels after this morning ritual.

üåô Night - I replace Pure C 5.5 Glow Serum with Vitamin VC-IP 1.0 Firming Serum to boost collagen production for firmer and brighter skin. Then, use the same Snail Mucin Essence and Snail Mucin Peptide Facial Cream for skin protection.

I love the glowy result that these products offer, and the Jumiso Snail Mucin 95% + Peptide Essence is a must if you want to have dewy glass skin in Summer without feeling greasy.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Paula's Choice today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Octinoxate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a thin fluid texture
- No white cast on my skin tone¬†
- Can leave some residue in my facial hair, but not too noticable
- I did get pilling from this
- Has a natural finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Doesn't sting my eyes
- Around $45 for 60mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Sephora.
üîÜ
This reminds me a lot of their Youth Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid. Quite similar in texture and my experience using them. So if you love that one, this new sunscreen is worth checking out. I like the addition of the Vitamin C. Overall I don't love this one and how it sits on my skin. Like it almost sits on top of my skin and emphasized my texture. And I got pilling from this. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new tinted mineral sunscreen from Kopari today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Zinc Oxide
- It has a fluid, medium tint
- Light white cast on my skin tone¬†
- Leaves residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural glowy finish, dry touch feel
- No added fragrance
- Doesn't stings my eyes
- Around $38 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Sephora.
üîÜ
One of the better mineral sunscreens I have tried. But still a bit of a cast. Pretty sheer but not 100% clear or transparent. Dries down really nicely, no streakiness to it. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new tinted mineral sunscreen from Beauty of Joseon today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Zinc Oxide
- It has a light fluid texture
- 12 shades for different skin tones
- Provides a decent about of coverage with a brush
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural radiant finish
- No added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $20 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website.
üîÜ
The shades are pretty nice. I'd say they are flexible considering 2 or 3 could work for me depending on the undertones and what I use on top of it. It lasts on my throughout the day without breaking down or getting too greasy. But if is definitely a radiant finish. If you want matte, you can mattify it with a powder on top. I was able to comfortably apply a good amount of this to get the full protection, but I personally still would use my regular sunscreen and use a thinner layer of this on top as a skin tint, not my standalone sunscreen. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

""Say goodbye to forehead lines and wrinkles with these top skincare tips! ‚ú® Consistency is key, so remember to hydrate, use sunscreen, and incorporate a retinoid into your routine. Botox or fillers can also work wonders. Embrace a smoother, youthful complexion!""

1.  Hydrate Regularly:  Keeping your skin moisturized helps plump the skin and reduce the appearance of lines.  
   Hashtags: #Hydration #Moisturize #HealthySkin #PlumpSkin #SkinCareEssentials #WrinklePrevention

2.  Use Sunscreen Daily: UV rays accelerate skin aging, so apply sunscreen every day to prevent further damage.  
   Hashtags: #Sunscreen #SPFProtection #SunDamage #AntiAging #UVProtection #YouthfulSkin

3.  Incorporate Retinoids:  Retinoids boost collagen production, reducing fine lines over time.  
   Hashtags: #Retinoids #CollagenBoost #AntiAgingSkincare #SmoothSkin #SkinRenewal #WrinkleFighter

4.  Try Botox:  Botox relaxes the muscles responsible for forehead lines, smoothing the skin temporarily.  
   Hashtags: #Botox #WrinkleTreatment #SmoothForehead #YouthfulAppearance #CosmeticTreatment #AgingGracefully

5.  Use Hyaluronic Acid:  This ingredient helps retain skin moisture, making wrinkles less visible.  
   Hashtags: #HyaluronicAcid #HydratedSkin #MoistureLock #PlumpSkin #AntiWrinkle #GlowingSkin

6.  Apply Vitamin C: A potent antioxidant that brightens skin and boosts collagen, reducing fine lines.  
   Hashtags: #VitaminC #Antioxidants #BrighteningSkin #CollagenBoost #AntiAgingSkincare #RadiantSkin

7. Avoid Over-Exfoliation:  Over-exfoliating can thin the skin, making wrinkles more pronounced.  
   Hashtags: #GentleExfoliation #SkinCareBalance #HealthySkin #SkinCareRoutine #ExfoliationTips #WrinklePrevention

8. Stay Hydrated:  Drinking plenty of water keeps skin supple and reduces wrinkle depth.  
   Hashtags: #StayHydrated #WaterForSkin #HealthyLifestyle #SkinHydration #YouthfulGlow #AntiAging

9. Facial Exercises:    Strengthening facial muscles can help reduce the appearance of lines.  
   Hashtags: #FacialExercises #FaceYoga #NaturalBeauty #SkinFirming #AntiWrinkle #HealthySkin

10. Get Enough Sleep:  Quality sleep allows your skin to repair itself, reducing the formation of new wrinkles.  
   Hashtags: #BeautySleep #RestfulNights #SkinRepair #SleepAndSkin #HealthyHabits #YouthfulSkin

11. Healthy Diet:
 Consuming antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids helps maintain skin elasticity.  
   Hashtags: #HealthyDiet #SkinElasticity #Omega3 #Antioxidants #NutritionForSkin #GlowingSkin

12. Avoid Repetitive Facial Movements: Repeated expressions like frowning can deepen lines over time.

üí∏ After browsing countless makeup reels, I purchased the Tower 28 BeachPlease Cream Blush from Sephora. Initially, I had my eyes set on the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush. However, upon seeing it in person, I hesitated because of its highly pigmented colors and the potential to enhance my already large pores with its luminous effect. ‚ú®

ü§© Surprisingly, I stumbled upon the Tower 28 BeautyPlease Cream Blush in a hidden area, not prominently displayed on the shelf. It was üíï love at first sight! I was drawn to its creamy texture, intense yet not overly pigmented colors, and its sleek and simple packaging. The transparent cover made it easy for me to choose the shade. üôå

üéÄ I must admit, I‚Äôm head over heels in love with this cream blush. I picked up the shades üòçHappy Hour, a sun-kissed coral pink, and üí≠ Dream Hour, a bright pink, for my daily look. Both shades are perfect for spring and summer, and I love their buildability. I apply them with my fingers, tapping the color onto my cheekbones. The best part is that there‚Äôs ‚ùå no glitter or ‚ùå shimmer, so it doesn‚Äôt accentuate my pores.

I‚Äôve also applied it to my lips, and the cream blush gives a velvet, blurry finish. üëÑ It‚Äôs cute, but I prefer a shiny effect, so I top it off with a clear lip gloss.

üí° Tips:

Try using this blush on a cream or liquid surface for seamless application. I apply it on top of a liquid foundation and gently press it with loose powder. You can also use it on the eye area or lips as cream eyeshadows or lipstick.

Our patient is here for some enhancements and fine tuning to her facial features. As she already has great structure, we just amplified her features to make her cheeks more defined, her under eyes refreshed, and her chin balanced.

She wanted some shaping to her lips üíã so we gave her a more defined cupid's bow as well as adding slightly more volume to her bottom lip.

By adding filler to her tear troughs, we fixed the hollowness she had noticed under her eyes üëÅÔ∏è

We also injected some filler to her marionette area for anti-aging purposes, to prevent sagging and to reduce creases from forming there.

She got exactly what she came for and is loving her results! üéâ

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this mineral sunscreen from Minu today! 
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide
- It has a gel cream lotion texture
- Leaves a white cast on my skin tone
- Does not work well in my facial hair
- Has a natural finish
- Does not sting me eyes
- Around 12 pumps to get the necessary amount for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- No added fragrance or essential oils
- Water resistant
- Around $58 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or credo beauty.
üîÜ
This tint is definitely darker than I expected, but this is still a mineral sunscreen at the end of the day. I do like that it blends in evenly and it doesn‚Äôt leave streaks on my face. It is water resistant and feels lightweight on the skin. Says that ‚Äúonce blended into skin, the tint will vanish and the light reflecting pigments will produce a luminous brightening effect.‚Äù That does not seem to be the case on my skin tone because there definitely is a visible white cast left on me. I don‚Äôt really like that ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù tint claim when it leaves a white cast on deeper skin. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Even though these have a more lightweight formula than my usual preference, I LOVE them. They have a slight smoothing appearance on the lips (which is rare for a thinner formula!) and though they have a cooling sensation, I don‚Äôt find it irritating.

They‚Äôre $26 and come in 6 shades and while the brand claims they have a sheer tint, you can see on my lips and arm swatches that they are all basically clear. Here are the scents:
Green Dragon¬†- Sage and peppermint¬†
Cookie Dough¬†- Tahitian vanilla*
Orange Crush¬†- Citrus scent
Pink Magic¬†- Watermelon
Dream Machine¬†- Guava*
Chocolate Cake¬†- Cacao*
* my favorites

These have an extremely thin, lightweight, somewhat slippy formula and a chubby doe foot applicator. If you want something hydrating and lightweight, in a range of yummy scents and no pigment - these are for you.

If you prefer a more plush,  cushiony, thick, tacky formula like I do, I recommend their Odyssey glosses instead.

5006,6.0,True,82.0,319000.0,"Alright, guys, let's talk FACIAL SCULPTING. This patient to me with a clear goal: to achieve a sharper, more masculine, and ultra-contoured look that is super in demand right now. He wanted definition, structure, and balance‚Äîa face that commands attention. And when it comes to achieving that kind of transformation, pairing filler with threads is how I can achieve the ultimate results.

For this patient, I strategically placed filler in his chin, cheeks, temples, and jawline to build volume where he needed it most, creating bold, defined angles while maintaining a natural look. The filler was all about structure‚Äîbuilding out the strong, masculine features he wanted. But sculpting the face isn‚Äôt just about adding volume; it‚Äôs also about lifting and refining. That‚Äôs where the threads came in.

By placing threads in his midface and jawline, I was able to lift and tighten the skin, enhancing his natural bone structure and giving him that sleek, chiseled look. The combination of filler and threads isn‚Äôt just powerful; it‚Äôs precise. Together, they work to create harmony and proportion while boosting collagen for long-lasting results.

What I love about this case is how it highlights the artistry of male facial sculpting. It‚Äôs not about overdoing it‚Äîit‚Äôs about accentuating the natural anatomy of the face, bringing balance and symmetry while maintaining a look that‚Äôs undeniably masculine. Many providers end up leaving their patients looking overdone, but not me. I know exactly how to achieve that subtle, yet effective look so my patients look great without anyone being able to guess they had anything done.

Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California. Dr. Emer is behind some of Hollywood's most defined bodies, impeccable skin, and chiseled facial features. He is an aesthetic visionary who dares to be different.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Round Lab today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Uvinul T 150, Mexoryl SX, Uvinul A Plus, and Parsol SLX
- It has a light cream texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural matte finish
- No added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $16 for 50mL. Can be purchased from retailers like Stylevana or Yesstyle.
üîÜ
Love the finish of this one. I feel like so many sunscreens I've tired recently have been on the glowy radiant side of things but this ended up being more of a natural matte finish. Works great for my oily skin throughout the day and reapplies well. It is creamy but lightweight on the skin. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

1Ô∏è‚É£Use hydrating skincare, especially skincare that focuses on hydrating ingredients like glycerin, panthenol and urea
2Ô∏è‚É£Avoid exfoliation and retinoids while you heal
3Ô∏è‚É£Use gentle cleanser 1x a day, washing with water in the AM can avoid over stripping your skin.
4Ô∏è‚É£Use ceramides, cholesterol and fatty acids, these are the 3 major lipids that make up your skin barrier and are the building blocks that help you heal!

Use my code ZOERAMM1E on Yesstyle and Oliveyoung Global ü´∂

Really like the packaging, so much more sanitary than normal cushions tbh

Green cushion (23W)
- Very natural finish (my mum couldn‚Äôt tell I was wearing foundation)
- Better if you want higher coverage
- Thicker formula and clung to my dry patches (maybe better for oily skin)
- Didn‚Äôt settle into pores
- Could get a little cakey towards the end of the day, so make sure to blend and set well
- Lower SPF than the pink cushion üò¢

Pink Cushion (23W)
- prefer this one a lot more
- glowy/hydrating cushion, so this was really good for my dry skin
- Didn‚Äôt settle into pores
- Felt more blendable than the green one
- Thinner formula which I prefer
- Only 3 shades (1 less than the green one)
- SP50++ üôå
- lighter coverage
- Still looked good as new after 5 hrs???

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Tocobo today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Uvinul T 150, Mexoryl SX, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, and Parsol SLX
- It has a light cream texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural radiant finish
- Has added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $13 for 50mL. Can be purchased from retailers like Stylevana or Yesstyle.
üîÜ
Tocobo has a blue version of this that was one of my favorite sunscreens last year, so I had to try this one when I found about about it! In comparison this one is just probably a little geared more to drier skin types, or colder weather. For my oily skin, I would probably stick with the blue bottle, but this is still great. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

‚ú®YesStyle Reward Code: BEAUTYKAT321 ‚ú®

I always wanted to try K-Beauty Toner Pad and after doing some research, I chose 
Numbuzin No.3 Radiance Glowing Jumbo Essence Pad even though I seldom see people talking about it. ‚ù§Ô∏è What caught my eye are the product ingredients which contain 50 types of ferment extracts ü§© for skin revitalization, and they use üåø biodegradable and unbleached vegan cotton ‚òÅÔ∏è for cotton pads which I was impressed with. 

After 3 weeks of usage, I totally fell for this product ‚ù§Ô∏è - my skin is brighter and smoother, and the blackheads on my t-zone area seem less visible. ü•∞

Having said that, this product is not a purely hydrating essence pad but a brightening, gentle-peeling product that also contains fruit extracts for 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Removing skin impurities and dead skin cells,
2Ô∏è‚É£ Refining skin texture and large pores, and 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Promoting clear and transparent skin complexion 

So AVOID EYE AREAS as instructed ‚ö†Ô∏è 

Since I have normal to dry skin and I try this product in Winter, I will use this essence pad to wipe my face only in the evening which helps me to remove the last trace of makeup and impurities without drying my skin. 

I will also use it as a facial mask but only 2-3 times a week and leave the mask on my skin for 3 minutes. I learned my lesson as I left the mask on the skin for almost 10 minutes while recording this reel. My skin became tight and tingling when I removed the mask. I am not allergic to the product but I think the fruit extracts or other fermented ingredients are doing their jobs by removing excess sebum so if you leave the mask on the skin for too long, it becomes too much for the skin.

üëç It took me some time to adjust the product's usage but once I developed my routine, I could see the brightening result and I am happy about it. 

ü§î I think numbuzin No.3 Radiance Glowing Cotton Pad is the most underrated brightening toner pad from Korea. Do you agree with it? Share your favorite toner pad below. ‚¨áÔ∏è

‚≠êÔ∏è This is a physical (Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide) and chemical (Octocrylene) combined sunscreen that is water-resistant, sweat and sebum-resistant for up to 80 minutes. Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk SPF50 PA++++ is also a broad-spectrum sunscreen for the face and body, and No.1 best-selling sunscreen in Japan for more than 17 years.

ü•∞ What do I think about Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk SPF50+ PA++++?

‚òÄÔ∏è This sunscreen is in a milky-lotion texture ü•õ which glides on my skin so well and easily. It feels a bit sticky when I first apply it but it dries out within a minute. It is designed for all skin types but I think it is more suitable for normal to dry skin, and it doesn‚Äôt leave a ‚ùå white cast or ‚ùå greasy layer on the skin.

Even though I prefer Kanebo Allie Gel UV EX SPF 50+ PA++++ because of its‚Äô reef-safe formula, Shiseido is still a good alternative as it is waterproof, contains 50% skincare ingredients that create a smooth and silky finish which also acts as a skin barrier to protect the skin from the damages of harsh weather conditions.

Volume loss made him look tired and older than he felt. Gaunt cheeks and tired eyes weren't the look he was going for! He needed a refresh, a boost‚Äîand he knew exactly who to call: me! üòâüìû

So, how do we achieve this ""undetectable"" look? It's all about precision, artistry, and a deep understanding of facial anatomy and proportions. It's not just about filling lines; it's about restoring lost volume in strategic areas to rebuild the natural scaffolding of the face. Here‚Äôs the approach I took with this patient:

‚úîÔ∏è Mid-face and Cheekbones: The mid-face is crucial for a youthful appearance. As we age, we lose volume in this area, leading to flattened cheeks and a less defined contour. The key is to avoid overfilling, which can create an unnatural, ""puffy"" look. Instead, I focus on creating subtle definition and lifting the cheeks to restore a more youthful and defined contour. Boom.

‚úîÔ∏è Under-eye Area: Say goodbye to tired eyes. I banished shadows and smoothed things out, instantly revitalizing his entire look. My goal is to create a smooth, seamless transition between the lower eyelid and the cheek, creating a refreshed and rested appearance without looking ""done."" This is where the art of undetectable aesthetics truly shines ‚Äì the results are so natural that people will simply think you look well-rested and vibrant. Instant win!

Fast forward a few days, and the transformation is undeniable. He looks younger, healthier, and radiates confidence. His friends are blown away and they see a new level of energy and confidence! That's the Dr. Emer difference: game-changing results that speak for themselves.

The winning formula:
‚úÖ Sharper features, a stronger jawline, and defined cheekbones.
‚úÖ Bright, energized eyes that demand attention.
‚úÖ A naturally powerful, confident look.

This is about empowering my patients to look and feel their best by enhancing their natural beauty in a way that looks completely effortless!

What is it?

üç® This mask is in jello texture with tiny Lavender pedals, and 10% water from Lavender and Panthenol Flowers which provide intensive hydration to the skin with anti-inflammatory result. ‚úãüî•

It is made of high quality flowers üå∏ from Provence, and gently extracted and processed to preserve its properties for all skin types, even the sensitive skin.

My thoughts on this product üí≠

It is a fun product to use as I can use it 2-3 times a week or whenever I feel like having an extra hydration for my skin. I love storing it in the fridge for a cool, refreshing and tightening effect.

After cleaning, I apply this mask to bare skin and wait for 10-15mins. Then, I wet my skin with lukewarm water and gently massage it üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I find this method helps to brighten my skin complexion and remove dead skin cells while rehydrating my thirsty skin. üí¶

I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a magical face mask but considering the price ($14 @oliveyoung_global), it‚Äôs a good hydrating and calming mask for basic skin care.

üíú It does contain the scent of Lavender but it doesn‚Äôt bother me as I am a sucker of Lavender oil. üòÖ As long as it smells like natural Lavender essential oil, I am totally fine with it but it may not suit you if you are allergic to essential oils. As always, avoid eyes and lip areas.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from iT Cosmetics today!¬†
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a fluid texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No greyness in my facial hair
- Has a radiant finish
- Has added fragrance and essential oils
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $35 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Sephora
üîÜ
This is a new launch from the brand. I get skeptical whenever a brand puts invisible in the name because these brands love to lie about thatm but this is a chemical sunscreen and indeed actually invisible. It is very radiant of a finish. I doubt most people with oily skin like me will like this. But if you have dry skin, this is a pretty nice sunscreen to check out. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

üî¥ Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!


I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

Our patient‚Äôs never had filler before and was curious to try our famous Male Facial Sculpting treatment. He came in seeking a transformation that will perfectly balance, define, and structure his face. Having watched all our YouTube videos on male facial sculpting, he knew our signature male chin and jawline filler was the answer. We‚Äôre so grateful he trusted us to be his first time providers, and we must say, HE LOOKS INCREDIBLE.

It‚Äôs all about personalized, natural harmonization - no one-size-fits-all approach here.

Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California.

I‚Äôve always wanted to try Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush, and I finally got my hands on Hope (Nude Mauve - Beige Pink) and a mini size of Virtue (Beige Peach). I love this product‚Äôs pigmentation and weightless texture, which blends and builds beautifully for a soft, lightly dewy, and healthy look. üå∏‚ú®

I used only my fingers to blend the blush on top of my liquid foundation. It didn‚Äôt ruin my foundation or leave a rubbery residue on my face. But I was surprised by how pigmented the liquid blush was, especially in the shade Hope. Luckily, it was easy to correct the amount I applied. I simply used my clean hands to press my face lightly so some of the color transferred back to my hands, then used a tissue to clean it up. üôå

My advice: just place 1-2 dots on the back of your hand and apply a small amount to your face. It‚Äôs buildable, so you can add more as needed. I also use a loose powder to set the blush, so it lasts all day long. üïíüåº

By the way, these blushes are made in Korea. Do you know any dupes for Rare Beauty from K-Beauty? Will you choose Hope or Virtue? Share your thoughts below! üí≠üíñ

It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm following the pack‚Äîit‚Äôs because I push boundaries, innovate, and refuse to settle for less than life-changing results. This young patient walked into my office very depressed, her confidence shattered. She should‚Äôve been out laughing with her friends, posting selfies, living her best life. Instead? She was stuck hiding behind layers of makeup and drowning in self-doubt. Her mom was desperate to help her, to see her smile again! ‚òπÔ∏è

They had tried EVERYTHING. Different providers. Countless treatments. Pills, creams, promises‚Ä¶ and nothing worked. Her acne was severe, relentless, and so was her depression. This wasn‚Äôt just about skin‚Äîthis was about her life you guys! 

When they came to me, they knew one thing: I don‚Äôt follow the same rules as everyone else. Why? Because the old rules don‚Äôt get LIFE CHANGING results!

Here‚Äôs the deal: most dermatologists avoid advanced treatments while patients are on Accutane, still clinging to outdated textbooks. Not me. The times have changed, and so has my approach! I‚Äôve spent YEARS perfecting treatments that go deeper, work faster, and transform skin even on Accutane. Why wait for scars to form when we can stop them before they start?

I built her plan like I build all my treatments: customized, aggressive, and results-driven.

üî¨ Steam & Extractions‚ÄîStep one: clear the pores and prep the canvas. No fluff, just pure results.

‚ö° Halo Laser + BBL‚ÄîTo erase redness, inflammation, and even the playing field.

‚ú® Pixel RF Microneedling‚ÄîThis is where we level up: tightening, scar repair, collagen boost. Deep layers, real results.

üíä Accutane -- By layering these treatments with her Accutane therapy, we attacked her acne from every angle‚Äîinternally and externally‚Äîwithout compromising her skin‚Äôs healing process.

üíé Emer Skin Protocol‚ÄîThis is the secret sauce and they KEY to healing properly. My exclusive skincare regimen ensures her skin heals better, faster, and stronger than ever. No shortcuts. No skipping steps.

I didn‚Äôt pass this off to an aesthetician... I personally handled her treatments! Why? Because I knew what was at stake. For her, this wasn‚Äôt just about clearing acne‚Äîit was about regaining her life, her confidence, her happiness. 

Fast forward a couple of months, and her results are INSANE. The acne? Gone. The scars? Faded. Her pores? Practically invisible. She‚Äôs glowing like never before‚Äîinside and out! ü§©

This isn‚Äôt just about having clear skin. It‚Äôs about feeling like YOU again.

If you‚Äôre tired of waiting, tired of hiding, and ready to finally get the results you deserve, it‚Äôs time!

Our patient recently came to us for a surgical procedure where we removed his buccal fat pads in order to get him a slimmer look in his cheeks. We also performed some neck lipo on him in order to achieve a snatched jawline. Now that he has healed, he's back to build upon those results with some radiesse filler to his midface, jawline, and chin. The previous procedure is going to enable his filler to really pop so he was excited to see his results. Once everything settled, he was extremely satisfied with the sharper, more angular look we gave him. It was exactly what he envisioned when he came to us and he could not be happier.

As he is self conscious of his ""round"" profile, he desires more sharp and masculine features. We meticulously placed filler to project his chin and to create natural-looking definition to his jawline following that 90 degree angle. Balance is the focus, so we also added some filler to his mid face moving in a horizontal fashion across his cheek area. The cherry on top? We injected filler into the lips to give them a more hydrated and voluminous plumpness to them when he smiles and is at rest. He could not be happier with his final results once everything settled in.

üåûüåöYou can do either a nighttime or morning routine, and I prefer morning. All you really need is 3-5 mins and voila, you are stimulating collagen production little by little each day. 

üîëKeys to Success: 
1. Every. Single. Day for at least 90 days. It seems like a lot but the key to success in the beginning is building a consistent routine. It won‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt use it üòâ
2. Clean, dry skin. One of the main reasons it‚Äôs so simple to use too. Not messy gels or creams. 
3. Couple it with sunscreen during the day and retinol/tret at night to see the most success. 

üìùNote: I still have wrinkles and lines. My face moves. That‚Äôs ok. But it does help from deep lines from forming.

But did you try üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ a Hydrating Toner? - This helps replenish the water deep in your thirsty skin!

2Ô∏è‚É£ What about Slugging? - This helps to create a temporary barrier on your skin that holds the water in your skin, slowing down dehydration.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Do you use Ceramides? - These all important lipids help to stregthen your skin barrier (which is the reason your skin feels dehydrated, the skin barrier isn't working the way it's supposed to) get to the root cause of your dehydration by giving your skin barrier some love!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Maybe Facial Oil? - This might help in a few mays. Facial oil is not occlusive (popular myth) but it might help add a little more moisture that can resist the water escaping your skin. Certain oils have favorable fatty acid profiles that can help with a healthy skin barrier function (evening primrose, chia seed, sea buckthorn, rosehip).

5Ô∏è‚É£ How About Sleeping with Humidifier? -  A dry environment encourages trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) resulting in dehydrated skin. Try sleeping with a humidifier on to keep your space and skin hydrated.",Have you REALLY tried everything to solve your dehydrated skin? #skincaretips,5612.0,0.06594594594594595,10,2024-11-08T18:30:24.000Z,1,False,0,1,0.0031374484436140584,0.04756814537680385,False,False,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

He heard we were coming to the BIG APPLE and immediately booked himself an appointment so he could see the master of male facial sculpting. His goals were to increase the volume of his mid and upper face, as well as to  restore some lost volume to specific areas like his under eyes and temples using filled. We targeted his cheeks, jawline, chin, under eyes, and temples to create harmonious balance amongst his features. This gave him a contour across his face that will provide a noticeable enhancement to his appearance while maintaining a natural look.
The threads were crucial for helping him achieve the level of tightness and contour in his lower face to neck in order to complete the look 

Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California.

Hello lovelies, I've been seeing this Tir Tir Cushion foundation all over my social media feeds üòÇ but I haven't seen it featured much on medium brown skin tones, so here it is on my Indian skin. It provides a flawless, high-coverage finish with a satin matte/natural-looking appearance. It is longwearing too. 
However, if you have dry skin, be sure to do a good hydrating skincare routine underneath. ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§

Not only did she come to me ready to tackle her acne scars, but she‚Äôs also a nurse who works in the aesthetics industry‚Äîso she knows exactly how important it is to look and feel your best. She‚Äôs seen it all, and when it came time to invest in her own skin, she knew she had to come to me to get the kind of results no one else can deliver.

She was dealing with stubborn acne scars, including a deeper one on her nose from cystic acne. And trust me, when scars are that deep, a basic treatment isn‚Äôt going to cut it. That‚Äôs why I put together a fully customized approach‚Äîbecause you guys know I don‚Äôt do cookie-cutter treatments.

We hit her skin with a powerful combination of Halo and CO2 laser to break down scar tissue, resurface her skin, and smooth out that uneven texture. Then, I took things even further with my signature EMER cocktail‚ÄîAnteAGE Exosomes, PRP, and the EMER Skin Intense Hydration Mask‚Äîto not only speed up healing but supercharge her results. Because I don‚Äôt just treat the skin‚ÄîI optimize it. My goal isn‚Äôt just to get rid of scars, it‚Äôs to create healthy, glowing, rejuvenated skin that keeps getting better over time.

And the best part? She sang through the whole treatment. No joke. While I was working my magic, she was hitting every high note. Now, her skin is as smooth as her vocals.

Acne scars don‚Äôt have to be permanent. The key is the right combination of lasers, regenerative treatments, and expert post-care. And of course, no skincare routine is complete without EMER SKIN‚Äîbecause my post-treatment products aren‚Äôt just for healing, they take results to an entirely new level. That‚Äôs why patients, especially those in the aesthetics industry, trust me. They know I don‚Äôt just treat‚ÄîI transform.

If you‚Äôre ready to take your skin to the next level, you know where to find me. Let‚Äôs make flawless skin your new reality.

Send me a DM to start your journey towards smoother and more radiant skin!

I got my hands on #06 Mocha Bun, a warm-toned calm coral brown, and #08 Roasting Fig, a cool-toned milky rose with a hint of fig color. üçÇüíñ

‚ú® My experience: The texture reminds me of mochi which feels soft and bouncy. The dreamy packaging is a plus - the heart-shaped container with a tiny brush is almost too cute to use! ü•∞ I tried both colors on my lips for a soft matte finish and on my cheeks for a frosted blush look‚Äîboth turned out amazing! üíã‚ú®

The pigmentation is intense but super blendable, allowing you to build either a light or rich color on your cheeks. I‚Äôm obsessed with the whole experience, but one tiny downside: my #06 Mocha Bun smudged on the inner cover of the cap (probably a factory defect üòï). Still, I‚Äôm loving it! üíï

Which one would you pick‚Äî#06 Mocha Bun or #08 Roasting Fig? Let me know! üí¨üëá

üëâ avoid using any harsh exfoliants while healing (retinol, aha, bha, vitamin c, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide etc)

üëâ add soothing hydration to address dehydration symptoms

üëâavoid drying forms of alcohol, fragrance and essential oils as they can be irritating when your skin barrier is vulnerable

üëâuse a nourishing moisturizer or slug to help mimic the protective benefits of your skin barrier (because the one you got is out of commission right now)

üëâ be patient, healing can take time, allow at least 2-6 weeks (sometimes longer!)

‚ö†Ô∏èBUT! all of this is just soothing the SYMPTOMS of your damaged skin barrier (and those symptoms can be painful). You need to get to the source to heal your skin barrier and nothing does it better than ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids!

üî¨Why? Because your skin barrier is actually composed of these all important lipids (50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, 25% fatty acids).

üëâSo if your skin barrier is weak or damaged, make sure to give it some lipid love!‚ù§Ô∏è",the 1 thing you must do to heal your barrier...,35460.0,0.4166862514688602,10,2024-10-11T17:08:51.000Z,0,False,0,1,0.009071573777041398,0.02177039564592087,True,False,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not ready for Botox? I totally understand. You can still have smooth, plump skin without the needles. P-Tiox is a peptide alternative to Botox that gives you the look without the commitment. It relaxes your facial muscles and reduces fine lines, so you get that ‚ÄòBotox-like‚Äô effect without anything invasive.

And if you love a good plump, the HA Intensifier is your new best friend. It boosts your skin‚Äôs hyaluronic acid levels for a smoother, firmer appearance.

If you‚Äôre not ready to take the plunge into injections, this is the perfect place to start.","You can still have smooth, plump skin without the needles! üôåüèΩ üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1099.0,0.26104513064133017,25,2024-11-04T01:22:06.000Z,0,False,0,1,0.008549038233198766,0.03272727272727273,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

@makeupbymelissam works in the industry as a makeup artist for high profile clients like Selena Gomez, so she has to look her best. This all starts with the skin, so she came to us for our absolute favorite facial on the block--the Glacial Glide. Glacial uses cryo technology to quell inflammation and redness in the skin. It is remarkably cooling and relaxing with absolutely zero pain involved, making it a true patient favorite. Our patient here loved it and could not have been happier with her results. She noticed a visible improvement in her skin, citing the reduced redness and overall dewy look that only continued to improve as time passed. She left with a relaxing experience and angelic skin worthy of any red carpet all thanks to glacial.skin

(links are affiliate links) 
üß° Live Tinted Blush Crushes (https://creatoriq.cc/4dTsjJZ)
These are ultra-pigmented and feel almost serum-like to me. For the ultimate juicy cheek, these are a must and feel so lovely on my dry skin. 
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Fenty Suede Powder Blushes (https://creatoriq.cc/3SWrkAp)
These are so luscious, soft and silky! They apply like butter, are layerable and look heavenly. Plus, some of the shades are absolutely divine with their shimmer! 
üíñ Nudestix Stax All Over Color Blush Balm (https://creatoriq.cc/3XcU3n2)
These are the ultimate blush balm! These were surprising to me at first because they look like a powder.. but NO! They are a supple balm that looks beautiful on a full face of makeup or bare skin (my fave way to wear these). And you can use these on your cheeks, eyes and lips!

6362,0.0,False,6.0,475.0,"Products I really want to love but I don‚Äôt - Part II

1Ô∏è‚É£ Shiseido Integrate Flat Skin Maker UV SPF50 - This product is a multi-functional face moisturizer that is supposed to be used as a lotion, sunscreen, and makeup base for large pores. I always loved using Shiseido Integrate as the quality of this brand is impressive. üëç Unfortunately, this product irritates my eyes badly and my tears keep rolling after using it. ü•∫

2Ô∏è‚É£ SK-II Facial Treatment Essence - I used to sell it and it was our best-selling item at all times. My customers swear that it improves their skin texture and complexion but to be honest with you, it doesn‚Äôt do much on my skin and I don‚Äôt see a huge difference after using it for some time. üí∞ With this price tag, I would rather choose SK-II Clear Lotion, Facial Treatment Mask, SKINPOWER Advanced Cream, or Eye Cream. ü•∞

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sofina Primavista Day Treatment Balm Foundation Roller Type - this is a balm-like foundation with long-lasting moisturizing benefits. I love how it promotes light hydration but it takes time to roll and apply the foundation to my face. I have to admit that I pressed the roller too hard and the edge of it grasped the product randomly so the foundation looks bad after only 2 or 3 times of usage. On top of that, it attracts dirt and fiber easily. Such a bummer üòï!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Beauty of Joseon Matte Sun Stick - I love BOJ but this sun stick is a huge disappointment. üò£ It doesn‚Äôt glide on my skin and it creates rubbery residues. üò¢

5Ô∏è‚É£ Rare Beauty Positive Light Under Eye Brightener - after reading so many positive reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try and I don‚Äôt get it! ü§Ø It‚Äôs too light to cover dark eye circles, and it is too difficult to use with its metal applicator. For example, you have to use a fingertip to blend the product after applying it with the metal tip; and if you want to cool your under-eye areas solely by using the metal applicator, you have to blend the product later. In this case, I would rather have separate products for different purposes üôà

6394,2.0,False,20.0,476.0,"üå∏ Wake up with glassy, glowing skin without tackiness! üå∏

I never thought I could achieve glassy skin results overnight! If you‚Äôve followed me for a while, you know I have combination skin with large pores, so ‚Äúglowy‚Äù or ‚Äúradiant‚Äù products can be tricky as they tend to exaggerate my pores and textured skin. But that‚Äôs not the case with the Medicube PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Mask! Let me explain.

What is the Medicube PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Mask? This mask is designed to enhance skin elasticity, improve complexion, and give you that coveted radiant glow ‚ú®.

Enriched with salmon PDRN and low-molecular collagen, it strengthens your skin barrier, reduces dark spots, and promotes an even skin tone while deeply hydrating ü´ß.

üîë Key Ingredients:
Salmon PDRN: Known for its regenerative properties, PDRN helps repair damaged skin and improve elasticity.
Hydrolyzed Collagen: Low-molecular collagen penetrates deeply to hydrate and plump the skin.

Skincare Benefits:
Improves skin elasticity ‚ú®
Reduces dark spots & brightens complexion üåü
Strengthens skin barrier üí™
Enhances hydration for a glass skin glow üíß

How to Use It:
Leave it on for 3‚Äì4 hours or overnight.

My Experience:
I just tried the Medicube PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Mask, and WOW, my skin has never looked better! üòç After leaving it on overnight, my skin was GLOWING in the morning! The mask didn‚Äôt budge at all, and despite a slightly tight sensation, the end result was absolutely worth it. ‚ú®

The coolest part? The jelly changes from pink to transparent, showing it‚Äôs absorbed perfectly into my skin üíß. I wore it overnight, and despite a slight tight feeling (it‚Äôs like my skin was wrapped up!), the results were totally worth it. I woke up with smoother, glowing skin - no greasiness or stickiness üôå!

If you‚Äôre looking to up your skincare game, this one is a must-try! üíØ

Detailed review below: 

The whole line is scented but to me the smell is not overbearing at all which is a plus.

The rich one shampoo: 8/10~ it‚Äôs a great cleanser my hair and scalp felt clean on the first round,  It foams a lot and quickly. Now I do wish it had more moisture because when I rinsed my hair the second time it did feel a little bit dry and I would not be able to detangle my hair.

The rich one conditioner: 9.5/10~ now this was very moisturizing as soon as it hit my hair, I could feel the softness in the slip in my hair was amazing. I could‚Äôve detangled my whole head easily with it.

The richer one deep conditioner: 7/10~ for a deep conditioner the slip wasn‚Äôt amazing The consistency was lighter than the conditioner. Probably why my hair didn‚Äôt really love it like that. But for looser hair texture it might be great. 
However i will try it again without the conditioner and leave it on to see if it makes a difference.

Normally I don‚Äôt post first impressions on my feed but I feel pretty confident in my initial reaction.

This is a $26 multi-use sparkle stick from Dose of Colors called ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Literally Magic‚Äù in the shade Icy. They also have a multicolored sparkle shade which I am purchasing immediately.

This has transparent base pigment with tons of icy sparkles. It glides on like a dream and easily disperses the glitter without ANY fallout. Like‚Ä¶.zero. I don‚Äôt know how they did it.

I noticed a subtle cooling effect which was kind of nice.

After 5 hours, this still looked like brand new, no creasing, no fallout.

Holy hell dose of colors, WE NEED MORE SHADES!!!

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Beauty of Joseon today!
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Uvinul T 150, Mexoryl XL, Mexoryl SX, Uvinul A, Tinosorb S
- It has a creamy fluid, lightweight feel
- No white cast on my skin tone¬†
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural satin finish
- No added fragrance
- Doesn't stings my eyes
- Around $15 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Stylevana or YesStyle. Code SHOPGSG for a discount on Stylevana.
üîÜ
If you weren't a fan of the original relief sun sunscreen like me, you might enjoy this one. Because all the things I didn't like about that one are improved here. This has no Tinosorb M, so this leaves no whitecast on me or residue in my facial hair. This finish is much less glowy too. A great everyday sunscreen. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

I personally prefer to air dry my hair to minimize the use of hot tools, but I often times see more frizz that can sometimes make a good hair day go bad.
I used a pea sized amount on clean, towel dried brushed hair and let it air dry. Hair did not feel heavy, or weighted down throughout the day.
The next day I used it on dry hair and was thoroughly impressed at how it minimized frizz instantly.
Complete Air Dry Cream also has a soft scent that isn‚Äôt overpowering, which I think is an added bonus!

Gifted by Medicube

This high-tech, 2-in-1 tool uses Dual Tune-Wave‚Ñ¢ technology to work magic on skin elasticity and fine lines, leaving your skin smooth and supple. üôå‚ú®

üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Home Spa Vibes: No need for special gels; simply use it after your skincare product is fully absorbed. However, I use it with Aloe Vera Gel, Medicube Collagen Jelly Cream, and Medicube PDRN Pink Peptide Serum. All of these work perfectly with the device ‚Äì I feel more heat if I wait for the product to absorb, so I prefer using the device with Aloe Vera Gel or Medicube Collagen Jelly Cream. üå∏ It glides on the skin better with the gel and I feel more relaxed while using the RF Ultra Tune.

üîã Powerful Yet Gentle: Combining RF (radio frequency) and MC (microcurrent) tech, it boosts skin elasticity and contours, leaving your skin looking firmer and more youthful. üíñ

üì± Maximize Results with the AGE-R App: Track your progress, get personalized tips, and optimize your routine with custom settings! üåü

‚ú® How RF and MC work in skincare:

RF (Radio Frequency) uses electromagnetic waves to heat the deeper layers of the skin, stimulating collagen and elastin production. This helps to improve skin elasticity, reduce fine lines, and promote a firmer, youthful appearance. The gentle heat also encourages blood circulation, making your skin look more radiant and toned. ‚ú®

MC (Microcurrent) uses low-level electrical currents to stimulate facial muscles. This helps tone and lift the skin, improve contours, and reduce sagging. It also supports the absorption of skincare products, boosting overall skin health and vitality. üíñ

Some of you may know that Medicube has different beauty devices, so how is the Medicube RF Ultra Tune 40.68 different from their similar devices ‚Äì the Deep Shot and Age-R Booster Pro (6-in-1 device)?

‚ú® How is it different from the Deep Shot?
The key difference is that the Ultra Tune operates at a frequency approximately 20 times higher than the Deep Shot, providing more powerful RF elasticity care without the need for a separate gel! üí´ Plus, while the Deep Shot combines RF and ultrasound waves and is recommended for use 2-3 times a week, the Ultra Tune uses RF + MC technology, making it perfect for daily use. üëè

‚ú® How is it different from the Age-R Booster Pro (6-in-1 device)?
The Age-R Booster Pro combines Electroporation, Microcurrent, EMS, and Electric Needles for different skin care purposes, focusing on vibration for muscle training, skin firmness, pore care, anti-aging, and glowing results. Meanwhile, the RF Ultra Tune 40.68 is designed to give you a luxurious at-home experience, focusing on RF technology that targets skin elasticity, fine lines, and pore care. ‚ú®

üí´ My Experience: After using it for 2 weeks, I‚Äôve noticed smoother skin, refined pores, and even some subtle improvement in my laugh lines! üòç I love how gentle it feels, with no muscle twitching like other devices. I‚Äôm definitely seeing potential for long-term results! üí™‚ú®

üëÄ Ready to experience the ultimate skin-lifting treatment from the comfort of your own home? Try the RF Ultra Tune 40.68 today! üåü

üî¥ Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!


I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

If you have a flat lip line like me and don‚Äôt have time for detailed lip contouring, here‚Äôs a quick tip to achieve fuller lips with natural results:

First, apply a glossy lip gloss to fill in your lips. 

Then, use a lip liner with a rounded tip in a shade similar to your lip gloss to define your natural lip line. Start by drawing the lower middle part, followed by the upper middle part‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry about being perfect! I like to create a rounded, smooth shape and slightly extend the line outside my natural lip line for a more natural, feminine look.

Next, extend the lip liner towards the sides of your lips. Avoid making sharp points at the corners‚Äîrounding them off will give you a softer, younger appearance.

What do you think of this simple technique? Let me know!

Our patient is in the process of getting a refreshed look, having done another treatment days prior. Today, with the help of Miracu PDO threads, we will be taking her makeover to the next level. She was seeing sagging and drooping in her skin, so to restore and enhance the contours of her face, we used an innovative technique involving the strategic placement of supportive threads in her upper, mid, and lower face. Through this process, we defined and sculpted her natural features. Now, she‚Äôs turned back time, and achieved the natural youthful appearance she wanted! 
 
LONG LASTING
You want to be sure that the provider you go to knows what they're doing and can perform this treatment correctly because these threads are extremely strong. They will grip and fixate the tissue for around ONE YEAR, so be sure to come to the best.

YOUR OWN TRANSFORMATION IS CALLING. ARE YOU GOING TO ANSWER?

Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California. Dr. Emer is behind some of Hollywood's most defined bodies, impeccable skin, and chiseled facial features. He is an aesthetic visionary who dares to be different.

Our patient wanted to achieve of more fresh and lively look so he came to us for a killer combination of @miracupdothreads and filler. He trusted only us with his face and was not willing to go anywhere else. This was because he has been following us on social media for quite some time and was impressed with the amount of contour we are able to bring out in our patients using threads and filler. Today, we used both filler and threads to increase the masculine look of his face while keeping him looking completely natural. 
     The goal was not to make him look like an entirely different person or overdone. We just wanted to subtly enhance his features to boost his masculine appearance. Once the swelling and bruising subsided, he was truly blown away by his spectacular results. We were able to magnificently create contour and sculpting to have him looking more chiseled and masculine. He loves it and so do we.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this mineral sunscreen from Everyday Humans today! 
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Zinc Oxide
- It has a light cream texture
- Leaves a white cast on my skin tone
- Does not work well in my facial hair
- Has a natural matte finish, dry touch velvety feel
- Does not sting my eyes
- No added fragrance or essential oils
- It does have that butyloctyl salicylate that acts kinda like a chemical UV filter but sometimes put in ‚Äú100% mineral sunscreens‚Äù
- Around $22 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Target.
üîÜ
Now this one is a mineral sunscreen so my hopes were not high however, I did love their sunscreen serum. That was one of my contenders for favorite sunscreen of the year last year, so I was open to the possibilities. I do appreciate the velvety dry touch feel of this sunscreen though. This may be a good mineral sunscreen for oily skin if you have a lighter skin tone and don't have coarse dark facial hair like I do. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

When it comes to K-Beauty, the selection is incredible but it can be confusing and overwhelming. This post will give you a rough idea of the products I am currently using, and you can easily find them on Prime Day at a special price. üéâüíñ

Medicube Zero Pore Pads - Dual-textured facial pads infused with Salicylic Acid (BHA) + AHA + patented pore care ingredients to help exfoliate dead skin cells. I love how it minimizes my oil production, so my skin looks more refined and stays fresh all day. Perfect for hot and humid summer days! üåû‚ú®

Medicube Deep Vita C Capsule Cream - An innovative skincare product that combines a transparent gel with Vitamin C capsules to deliver a fresh, potent dose of Vitamin C with each use. It provides a subtle, instant glow to my skin without feeling heavy. I use it twice a day with my regular skincare routine, and the finish is perfect! üçäüí´

Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Cream - Contains Birch Tree Sap that nourishes the skin by decreasing inflammation and hydrating with its extensive minerals. I love the gel-creamy texture of this cream that feels weightless, and it sinks into my skin quickly. üåøüíß

AXIS-Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum - A 5% Niacinamide-based serum that corrects dark spots and improves uneven skin tone. It helps to improve my acne and post-acne marks. Amazing results! üåüüôå

Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum - Contains 2% Retinal Liposome to reduce wrinkles and revitalize the delicate eye area. I noticed moisturizing and firming results after using this eye cream for only two weeks ‚Äì my fine lines have improved, and my under-eye areas have become smoother and firmer. üëÅÔ∏è‚ú®

üî¥ Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!


I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

I didn‚Äôt fill in the shadow of my smile lines because I wanted to lift my cheek areas and make the smile lines less visible. How do I achieve this result?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a light concealer (one shade lighter than your skin tone) to minimize the shadow of your smile lines.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use the triangle method, applying concealer in a ‚Äòcat whiskers‚Äô direction.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Press and blend the concealer upwards to fill in pores and create the illusion of lifted cheeks. You can also use your fingers to press the concealer.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Apply liquid foundation.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Set the makeup with loose powder.

Sometimes I skip liquid foundation and just press loose powder after concealer if I want sheer coverage.

What‚Äôs your makeup routine? Do you skip liquid foundation and use concealer and loose powder instead? üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíï

Our patient has noticed her under eyes appearing hollow due to aging and volume loss. She also wanted a bit of facial sculpting to fine tune her facial features. Using filler, we were able to liven her eyes up leaving them more refreshed and rejuvenated. To go the extra mile, we added the smallest amount of filler to her brow area to accentuate her eyes even more- leaving them looking more awake. As she naturally has great structure, we only gave her slight enhancements to her chin and softened the nasolabial folds. By diligently injecting filler to her chin, we created balance among her features as well as crafting that beautiful heart shaped look. She is absolutely loving her results and how refreshed she looks.

I wanted this to be a meal so I added Greek yogurt and protein powder but you don‚Äôt have to do that. I do eat quite a healthful diet so this was cost effective for me, but it depends what kind of ingredients you keep in your kitchen.

I eye-balled everything and this made a little over two servings!

I chose to omit the colostrum, dragon fruit powder, and magnesium powder, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs one of the reasons the price is so high at Erewhon. (I take a magnesium supplement already and I don‚Äôt see the need for colostrum or dragon fruit powder. TBH colostrum makes me feel a little ethically wrong but curious to hear your thoughts.)

I didn‚Äôt like that the Erewhon smoothie was basically all fruit and little substance, so I highly recommend adding protein like I did!

My version:
Frozen mixed berries
Frozen dark cherries
Frozen pineapple
Tart cherry juice
Coconut cream
Almond milk
Greek yogurt
Vanilla protein powder
Maple syrup

Erewhon‚Äôs ingredients:
Dark cherries
Pineapple
Avocado
Tart cherry juice
Almond milk
Coconut cream
Colostrum
Magnesium powder
Maple syrup
Dragon fruit powder

Smoothies are so easy because you don‚Äôt have to measure anything and you can just throw in whatever you feel like that day, and it‚Äôs a great way to get more fruits and veggies into your diet.

My whole life I‚Äôve wanted an eyebrow piercing and stacked ears, but because hEDS causes poor wound healing I‚Äôve had to let all of mine close up except my standard earlobe piercings. It‚Äôs just not in the cards for my body.

When I saw the Half Magic face pearls I was so excited because it gave me the option to look like I have an eyebrow piercing without actually puncturing my skin!

They‚Äôre $18 and have adhesive on each stud, but I always put down a bit of lash glue first because I don‚Äôt find the adhesive to be very strong.

No-needle microneedling is something that I find very interesting. I‚Äôm not sold on the efficacy, but the idea that there is a safe, but effective way to get microneedling results at home is fantastic. As an aesthetician, I‚Äôve helped so many people who have tried to do microneedling at home and damaged their skin, caused irreversible scarring, or spread infections such as staph bacteria. 

It can be really dangerous if you‚Äôre not trained properly. The idea that these might be safe alternatives is extraordinarily exciting for me as someone who wants others to have the best products for the best results, without unnecessary damage.

Last week I saw a reel where Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil was added to BabyFacial and I had to try!
I added three drops to four (maybe 3) pumps of BabyFacial and masked for ten minutes. While I still felt a tingle, it wasn‚Äôt as pronounced as it typically. Skin looked radiant & felt smoother after just 10 minutes.

Our patient came to us to achieve her ideal lip volume and symmetry as she was unsatisfied with her current lips. We gave her a keyhole pout, added volume to her upper lip, and enhanced her Cupid's bow - giving her more elevation and shape to her lips. Most importantly, we made her lips as symmetrical as possible while still keeping that natural look. She absolutely loves her results!

This new launch has quickly become a favorite for this month because of how great the spray/mister is on this. Feels so luxe and the product in it feels that way too. I love to have calming and soothing products like this in my routines to help keep my skin on track with the amount of actives I use. Featured ingredients:

- Strengthening the skin barrier: Ectoin and Panthenol
- Soothing the skin: Cica and Allantoin
- Giving deep hydration: Polyglutamic Acid and Aloe Leaf Juice

If you know another super fine mist, let me know! I'm always looking out for more‚òùüèæ

Korean Glass Skin: The Ultimate Skincare Trend 

Korean beauty (K-beauty) has taken the global beauty industry by storm, and one of its most iconic trends is the concept of ""glass skin."" Glass skin refers to a complexion that is incredibly smooth, luminous, and translucent, much like a piece of glass. Achieving this flawless, dewy look is the result of meticulous skincare routines designed to nourish, hydrate, and perfect the skin over time.

At the heart of glass skin is the idea of healthy, well-hydrated skin. It‚Äôs not just about masking imperfections or covering up with makeup. Instead, glass skin emphasizes the importance of achieving beauty from within, using a combination of skincare products and techniques that focus on long-term results. The goal is a clear, even-toned complexion that reflects light effortlessly, giving the face a radiant, almost ethereal glow.

     The Key Components of a Glass Skin Routine

Achieving glass skin involves a comprehensive skincare regimen, with a focus on hydration, exfoliation, and protection. Here are some key steps:

1. Double Cleansing: The first step in the glass skin routine is the K-beauty staple of double cleansing. This process involves using an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, followed by a water-based cleanser to thoroughly clean the skin. Proper cleansing is crucial for preventing breakouts and ensuring that the skin is prepared to absorb subsequent skincare products.

2.      Exfoliation: Regular exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, promoting smoother and brighter skin. Gentle exfoliants like AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes work to unclog pores and refine skin texture without causing irritation, which is important for maintaining the smooth, clear base necessary for glass skin.

3. Toning : Korean toners are designed to hydrate and balance the skin‚Äôs pH, as well as prepare it to absorb serums and moisturizers. Hydrating toners, often infused with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water, deliver essential moisture to the skin, making it appear plump and fresh.

4. Essences and Serums : Essences are lightweight, hydrating liquids that help boost the skin‚Äôs moisture levels. Serums, on the other hand, are more concentrated and are used to target specific skin concerns such as hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or dullness. Layering these products is key to achieving the deep hydration that gives glass skin its signature reflective quality.

5.  Moisturizing. : A rich, hydrating moisturizer seals in all the previous layers of hydration. Look for moisturizers with humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which draw moisture into the skin, as well as emollients like ceramides and fatty acids to strengthen the skin barrier and lock in moisture.

6. Sunscreen. : The final step, and perhaps the most important, is applying sunscreen. UV protection is critical to prevent sun damage, which can lead to premature aging and dull skin. Korean sunscreens are often lightweight and formulated to leave the skin looking dewy, adding to the overall glow.

      Why Is Glass Skin So Popular?

The appeal of glass skin lies in its emphasis on natural beauty. Unlike makeup-heavy trends, it focuses on achieving a healthy, radiant complexion that doesn‚Äôt rely on cosmetics for coverage. Instead, it encourages a holistic approach to skincare that prioritizes hydration, nourishment, and protection. Moreover, the glow achieved with glass skin makes the face appear youthful, fresh, and vibrant ‚Äî qualities that are universally desired.

Ultimately, glass skin is more than just a trend; it‚Äôs a lifestyle that promotes skincare as a form of self-care, teaching individuals to appreciate the beauty of healthy, well-maintained skin.#love

If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable way to sculpt and brighten your face, the ColorPop Just A Flush Cheek Palette is the perfect solution! For only $9, this all-in-one cheek palette includes 2 blushes, 1 highlighter, and 1 bronzer to give you that multi-dimensional, natural glow. üòç

Here‚Äôs my Step-by-Step Tutorial on how to use it:
#
1Ô∏è‚É£ Highlight with ‚ÄúSo Healthy‚Äù on the top of the cheekbones and the bridge of your nose for a subtle glow. ‚ú®
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Sassy Pants, the light pink shade, under your eyes to brighten your complexion. üå∏
3Ô∏è‚É£ Apply the Just Cheeky rose pink blush to your cheekbones for a rosy pop of color. üíï
4Ô∏è‚É£ Use Feisty Much bronzer on the sides of your nose, face, and tip of the nose for that soft contour. üåû

üé® My Experience:
This palette is perfect for my makeup needs, combining natural, buildable powders in just one compact! As an amateur makeup lover, I love how easy the shades are to blend with my fingers or brushes. They stay on without feeling cakey or heavy. Even though I bought mine for $12 at Ulta (what a bummer üòÖ), it‚Äôs only $8.40 on the ColourPop website! Such a great deal for such amazing quality! üôå

Today, I‚Äôm sharing a transformative case where my patient wanted to enhance his facial structure and achieve a sharper, more defined look. We focused on key areas like the chin, jawline, midface, temples, and under-eyes to bring out his best features.

Using advanced filler techniques, we created natural, masculine contours that align with his goals. The results? A stronger, more confident profile that looks completely natural and tailored to his facial anatomy. These subtle enhancements make a big impact, boosting his overall facial harmony while maintaining his individuality.

I love working with patients to bring their vision to life, and this case is a perfect example of how male facial sculpting can help redefine and refine. If you‚Äôve been considering similar treatments, let‚Äôs discuss how we can help you achieve your goals‚ÄîDM me or book your consultation today! üíâüí™

Description: ‚ÄúOur peptide-powered, ultra-hydrating gloss instantly plumps and revives lips with a hint of tint and all-day moisture for visibly fuller, smoother-looking lips.‚Äù

Formula: not thick or cushiony but noticeably grippy (or sticky if you prefer that word.) These have fantastic grip, which makes them super long-lasting and prevents them from sliding outside my lip border. I always prefer a more grippy formula so I love that they made this choice. The addition of peptides is exciting to me, I always prefer my lip products to have skincare benefits beyond hydration and moisture.

Scent: the website claims these have a citrus scent and a cooling effect. I don‚Äôt smell any citrus but I do notice a strong menthol cooling sensation. So strong that the scent and cooling effect last for 30 minutes before fading. Weirdly, I like it? Normally I hate menthol in lip products but something about this is refreshing and not irritating to me.

Shades (* indicates my favorites):
Emily (clear shimmer)
Marlene (light pink)
Maggie (fuchsia shimmer)*
Bamby (pink golden shimmer)*
Jo (pink mauve)*
Ruth (peach taupe shimmer)
Imani (natural almond)
Taylor (tangerine)
Jessica (raspberry red)
Liliana (deep berry)*

Shoutout: I LOVE the marketing for this. They showed each lip gloss on four different skin tones and featured models with full lips and thin lips with texture so you can see the differences. I‚Äôve been dying for brands to do that! Well done, Thrive.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from La Roche Posay today!¬†
üîÜ
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a fluid texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No greyness in my facial hair
- Has a radiant finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Doesn't sting my eyes
- Around 10-12 pumps to get the necessary amount for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- Around $40 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Dermstore.
üîÜ
I was confusing it with another one of their sunscreens that they released last year, but no, this one is new. It is beautiful in terms of texture and feel. This is probably my favorite American sunscreen that they have released. Only downside is that La Roche Posay US sunscreens are so expensive in a lot of comparisons. But if it's in your budget, it's not a bad product. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!
