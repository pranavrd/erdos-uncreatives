🌟 tfit Translucent Set Finishing Powder in Pink - This powder blurs my pores and keeps my skin matte while controlling sebum. I do wish the puff was a bit bigger and softer for easier application, but it’s still a game-changer! Just requires a little extra love. 💖

🎨 rom&nd Twinkle Pen Liner in 05 Sunset Hazel and 02 Golden Wave - I’m obsessed! I use Sunset Hazel for my eyeliner (it’s the perfect brown with a hint of red) and Golden Wave as a subtle liquid eyeshadow. I paired with the rom&nd Better Than Palette Eyeshadow Palette #00 Light & Glitter Garden for a natural, shimmery look! 🌈

💖 For lashes, I swear by Maybelline Sky High Mascara and the Shiseido Eyelash Curler. This duo is my holy grail! The mascara is waterproof but comes off easily with cleansing oil, and the curler? Just perfect for my eye shape! 😍

💦 Lastly, I spritz the MIGUHARA Vital Shine Mist Serum all over for that hydration boost. It feels amazing!

I’ve received my first PR gift 👏👏👏 from YesStyle and I am excited to share my thoughts on using this amazing face cream - Purito SEOUL Wonder Releaf Centella Cream. It is packed with K-Beauty staples like Cica, Squalane, and Ceramide NP for calming, moisturizing, and barrier-supporting care. It is vegan-friendly and the clinically tested formula is perfect for sensitive skin.

😇 I do not have problems with sensitive skin so I am a bit worried that the moisturizer may be too rich for my combination skin. To my surprise, my skin loves it 💖! The texture is luxurious and easy to spread on my face. The cream is rich yet lightweight so it creates a silky skin barrier without feeling greasy. No dry patches, no flaky skin, and no skin tightness 😊😊😊

I love the scent of the cream too! It is my beloved Lavender 🌿 ! I know some of you gals prefer unscented products (Purito SEOUL got an unscented version 🥰) but the extra kick of the essential oil soothes my nerves so well. I’ll fold my hands, cover my face, and take a deep breath when I use this cream in the evening. It helps me to unwind the stress and tension during the day🧘‍♀️

✨ Tips for using this cream:

1️⃣ After applying this cream, wait a minute till it is absorbed. Then, apply sunscreen as usual.

2️⃣ I will suggest using a sponge to press the foundation on the face instead of blending it after using Purito SEOUL Wonder Releaf Centella Cream. The foundation stays on my skin perfectly and this method won’t wipe out the protective layers of the cream.

3️⃣ If you have very sensitive skin and prefer something unscented, check out Purito SEOUL Wonder Releaf Centella Cream Unscented which has a similar formula for hypersensitive skin.

I love using this primer! As you can see in my reel, it blurs my pores and creates a matte finish without smudging or caking. ☺️

🔹Instant Pore Eraser: I only use the primer on my nose and the sides of my nose to minimize pores. I love the airbrushed finish, and it doesn’t mess up my sunscreen or foundation.

🔹While I don’t think it hydrates my skin, it doesn’t dry it out either. Perfect for the warmer season!

🔹Lightweight & Breathable: This primer feels like a second skin! Its lightweight formula is comfortable for all-day wear. I wish they would come out with a sunscreen version soon, so I can wear it without foundation and still have great-looking skin.

(Btw I apologize for the inconsistent lighting in this reel, I just figured out a solution today.)

The website says: “A youth enhancing water-based formula that delivers a long lasting stain plus sheer, buildable color, for naturally defined, plump & juicy lips.”

Texture:
These are one of the most comfortable lip stains I’ve tried. They have a hydrating, gel-like formula with a little bit of a cushiony feel that’s really nice on the lips. If I had to compare them to a similar K-Beauty product I’d say the Romand dewyful water tint comes close because they both feel ultra comfortable and non-drying.

Scent:
I detect a slight caramel smell but it’s so subtle I honestly don’t even know if I’m making that up.

Colors:
K-Beauty lip stains are usually super bright, so I like that Em launched a line of stains that are a bit different from what I usually see. They’re more muted and easy to wear. My favorite is enigma, which is a warm rose. I think the crowd favorite will be mirage, a slightly cool toned brown. Definitely a color I haven’t seen in a stain before!

Stain:
The only negative aspect I can think of is that the stain isn’t the most even I’ve tried. When I wipe these off, I notice a little patchiness on my lips that I don’t usually experience with my favorite stains. That said, it’s pretty subtle, but I did want to mention it.

Price:
These are $22 at Em Cosmetics and you can get 15% of with my code EM_STATEOFKAIT: https://rstyle.me/+w4ocQNjorfurQTPgdAia2w

I am glad that I can finally try I’m from Rice Serum 😍 I heard a lot of good things about this brand and their hero products, Rice Toner (check my last post for the product review) , Rice Serum and Rice Cream so I am excited to try them.

I am a sucker for face serum and this product works beautifully on my normal to dry skin. I love the milky texture of the serum, which is in between toner and milky emulsion, not too light and not too heavy which is great for all skin types. ☺️

I can feel that my skin is super hydrated after using the Rice Toner and Rice Serum. Both products give me a natural radiance without feeling greasy and I will use sunscreen after the products are absorbed to make sure my makeup stays in place. 😘

So what is I’m from Rice Serum?
It is a serum infused with 🌾 73% Rice Germ Fermented Extract from Rice Buds, blended with Niacinamide and Hyaluronic Acid.

So what are these ingredients for?

1️⃣ Promoting healthy skin, restoring skin radiance, and revitalizing dull skin complexion.
2️⃣ Providing deep moisturization.
3️⃣ With 73% Rice Germ Fermented Extract (retains over 65% of rice’s nutritional value), it helps to promote collagen production and improve skin elasticity.

I did worry about the texture when I first spotted it online as it looks a bit heavy but actually, It is weightless and refreshing! It is viscous when I apply it to my skin but it spreads out and is absorbed easily which leaves a sheen, silky, almost glowy finish to my skin. ✨

I use it with I’m from Rice Toner twice a day and I’m from Rice Cream at night. I love how hydrating these products offer and my normal to dry skin simply loves them 🥰.

Have you tried I’m from Rice Serum?

Our patient battled acne scars and textural issues on her face for years and it ravaged her self-confidence. After following us for almost two years, she decided that we were the best practice equipped to treat someone of her skin type. She came to us ready to finally have pristine skin that would change the way she feels about herself. She came to us last year for the first time and saw an incredible improvement in the quality of her skin after doing the Halo laser and @emer.skin. She understood that improving scars and skin is a multi-treatment process, so she came back again to see us so that she could further improve her skin. We got after it with aerolase and another round of Halo, and this time, we also used the Emer Skin Illuminating mask immediately after her treatment to help her skin reach a higher level of radiance. She is so thrilled that she made the decision to come to us, as the improvement in her skin has truly changed her life and boosted her self-confidence beyond measure.

Transforming appearances with precision and artistry is what I do best. My patient, who had a soft, youthful ""baby face"" wanted to bring a stronger, more masculine look. After extensive research, he chose me—the go-to expert for male facial sculpting—because he trusted my unparalleled expertise and attention to detail.
This transformation wasn’t just about adding volume; it was about creating balance, structure, and confidence. By sculpting his chin and sharpening his jawline, I crafted a bold, masculine look that still appeared completely natural. Every angle was meticulously shaped to enhance his features while maintaining harmony with his overall face.
The results were phenomenal. Once the filler settled, he couldn’t stop raving about how it elevated his appearance and aligned with his goals. His new, chiseled jawline, contoured cheeks, and balanced chin takes him from baby face to model. This is the kind of transformation I love creating—helping my patients look their best while feeling even better.

Our brand @dr.idriss had a booth yesterday at a conference that @sephora hosts for all their managers. It was a very overwhelming experience planning for it over the last few months, as we are one of the smallest brands they have in stores. And to make it even more intimidating, we were setting up alongside the plethora of multimillion dollar brands they have. 

Being fully self-funded (and in the process of funding clinical studies for R&D), can we say “err…on a budget” 🙋‍♀️ we had to work with what we have, and what we have was us 💪 

Standing out in an explosion of candy and hi-def color (and hair volume) we managed to distract and attract and had so much fun doing the damn thing💥 

Moral of this story: No matter the roadblocks, no matter the cost, when you can’t invest in things, always always always… invest in the people and yourselves 💜

A special thank you to this incredible lady @dima_osko for bringing the glam, the volume and my beach waves to life 🔥",Behind the scenes of the skincare brand #shorts,54654.0,0.03437358490566038,21,2024-08-16T20:51:00.000Z,1,False,0,1,0.0012893073652154937,0.0375080047571128,True,False,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

❤️ Get these eye creams at YesStyle or Olive Young Global. Enter my code BEAUTYKAT321 to save more. ♥️

🧐 Traditional Retinol Eye Cream - Some By Mi Retinol Intense Eye Cream contains 0.1% Retinol to target skin pigmentation and wrinkles. Retinol is the gold standard of anti-aging skincare – a vitamin A derivative that boosts collagen production and evens skin tone for a radiant complexion.

👀 I bought this eye cream about three months ago, and Some By Mi recently launched a new packaging for this product. Both the old and new versions incorporate Niacinamide for skin brightening, as well as Hyaluronic Acid and Panthenol for intense hydration.

What do I think about Some By Mi?

It glides easily onto the skin, and I love its creamy, luxurious texture. It rehydrates 💦 my under-eye areas so well and gives me a healthy glow right away. ⭐️

I noticed some improvements in my fine lines after using it for 3-4 weeks but the result is subtle. 😅

🔌 Meet the Powerhouse Cousin of Retinol - Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum contains 2% Retinal Liposome which incorporates natural lipids and oils, plus an active ingredient, 0.02% Retinal.

Retinal is converted directly to Retinoic Acid, which works faster and more effectively on the skin than Retinol.

What do I think about Beauty of Joseon?

I’ve been using it for almost a year, and I am in love with it. 🍦 The texture is creamy but lightweight, so it absorbs into the skin quickly.

However, it’s not rich enough for my under-eye areas if I use it in winter. I have to apply a serum before using this product, but I don’t need to when using Some By Mi.

I noticed moisturizing results after two weeks – my fine lines improved, and my skin became smoother and firmer. However, after a while, I didn’t see as significant a difference as I used to. 😅

💕 In short, I recommend both products:

❄️ Some By Mi Retinol Intense Eye Cream for dry and wrinkled skin;

✅ and Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum for all skin types.

The bronzer in Hey Honey is a very warm-toned shade with a hard-pressed cream formula that’s slightly emollient to help with the blend ability. I found it lasted on my face for several hours without fading, my only issue is that the color is a bit too orange on my cool skin. I’d really like to see a shade expansion in this line!

The blush in Blushing Berry is a gorgeous, bright cherry red with a more dewy formula than the bronzer. This faded from my face in about 20 minutes, so it’s unfortunately not worth keeping to me. My face eats cream blush so I tend to prefer matte liquid or cream formulas that adhere to my skin better. But if you don’t have that issue, I think this is a beautiful, affordable product.

The blush is $10.99 and the bronzer is $12.99 at Ultra.

He has been coming to us for nearly 8 years because he fully trusts us and always gets the best results. His main concerns are redness and brown spots on his skin, which is one of the main areas that ADVALIGHT is designed to address. This is an incredibly seamless treatment with little to no pain or downtime, making it absolutely perfect for our patient who has to get Emer ready for that red carpet in less than a week.
     To maximize results, our patient followed his Advalight treatment with the Emer Skin Illuminating Mask. This is how his skin reached that angelic level. He also used some other products from Emer Skin to further enhance his results. He is absolutely loving his results and all of Dr. Emer's after care products that helped him glow on the red carpet!

No treatment is complete without EMER SKIN.

✅ Re-Fit Eye

Our patient came to us wanting to see a higher level of sculpting in his body, particularly his arms. He had a vision of those hulking, super defined arms and he just wasn't able to achieve them with just his dedicated work in the gym. So, we went to work and carefully sculpted them out while grafting fat to his shoulders in order to round them. Many doctors are unwilling to perform liposuction in this area, as the anatomy is very delicate and requires only the utmost knowledge and skill. He chose us based on the high amount of results we post on our socials, so he felt extremely comfortable trusting us. We know the exact area to sculpt and were able to really define each critical area of his arms: his biceps, triceps, deltoid, and the shoulders. This latter portion was done by harvesting his fat, purifying it, and then grafting it into the shoulders in order to athletically round them, creating immaculate balance with his arms. ​We did more than just his shoulders and arms.
     IT DOESN'T END WITH SURGERY
He got stellar results from his procedure, but he wanted to get the absolute most out of it. So, he participated in our after care protocol which involved hyperbaric therapy, lymphatic massages, and IV therapy.  He also made sure he was eating right, working hard in the gym, and taking PEPTIDES such as MK-677 and CJC for muscle growth and growth hormone production. This stands as an excellent example of a patient who put in the work post-surgery to truly capitalize on and maximize his results.

Gifted by @mediheal_us and @bazzaal_

✨ What is Mediheal Madecassoside Blemish Pad? ✨
The Mediheal Madecassoside Blemish Pad is a soothing toner pad designed to calm and reduce the appearance of blemishes and dark spots on uneven, post-acne skin. Made with vegan fibers and enriched with Centella Asiatica and micro-particle Madecassoside, it helps keep your skin soft, hydrated, and nourished while improving skin tone and texture. These hypoallergenic pads are suitable for all skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin 🌿.

How to Use?
After cleansing, gently wipe the pad across your face to tone, moisturize, and prep your skin for day or night. You can also leave the pads on targeted areas like your forehead, cheeks, or chin for a quick, intensive skin fix! For extra hydration, use the pads as a mini sheet mask. 💦.

✨ My Experience with Mediheal Madecassoside Blemish Pad ✨

I love the soothing, calming, and hydrating effects of this blemish pad 😍. Despite not storing it in the fridge, it gives me a subtle cooling sensation after cleansing ❄️. I gently wipe my skin with the pad and often use it as a mini mask for rehydration. The square design is a game-changer — it stays perfectly on my skin, and I can even fold it to cover my nose!

Tip: After using the pad, my skin becomes soft and hydrated, which makes it easier to draw out sebaceous filaments (excess sebum) on my nose and prevent blackheads. I simply wrap my index finger with the pad (thanks to the vegan fibers, which aren’t too soft nor too stiff), then gently press and push on my nose 👃. The sebum sticks to the pad, which is much more effective and painless than using a stainless steel blemish remover 💥. Remember to use the pad at least once daily to keep the oiliness at bay!

If you’re like me and prefer gentle solutions, this pad is a great way to manage oiliness without causing redness or irritation. It’s versatile, convenient, and gentle enough for daily use. Will you try it? 🩷

This can be applied all over face with fingertips for an all over glow or apply onto areas that catch light & blend for a sheer, effortless glow. This can be used on bare skin or over makeup. Dew La La can also be mixed with your complexion products. I used it under makeup for a dewy glow ✨ 
Dew La La is available in 5 shades. Do you love an all over glow? Or just in areas that catch the light? Let me know in the comments 💭💭💭

1. ""Skincare stings and burns🔥""
 Me: damaged skin barrier. When your skin barrier is weak or damaged it's not doing it's job to protect the skin and keep the bad things from getting deep into the skin. This vulnerability means that skincare that worked fine on your healthy skin, can all of sudden cause irritation on skin with a weak barrier.

2. ""My skin is so oily 😓"" 
Me: dehydrated skin. Dehydrated skin is skin that lacks WATER, not moisture. It's a myth that only dry skin folks experience dehydrated skin symptoms. In fact, it's common that skin will overproduce oil to compensate for the dehydration. So if you're noticing more oil suddenly, consider your skin might be dehydrated.

3. ""I have itchy rough skin"" 
Me: eczema🤔 Not a diagnosis, but it might be a good idea to explore the possibility with a medical professional. Especially if that dry, itch patch of skin is red, oozing or painful. Eczema can be very common in cold and dry climates and can be fairly easy to manage if you know what you're dealing with!",What people say VS. what I hear as a skinfluencer...  #skincare,7059.0,0.08294947121034077,10,2024-11-01T16:55:38.000Z,1,False,0,1,0.002620415741295637,0.03158640226628895,False,True,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Price: $26
Scent: sweet vanilla scent (although it smells a bit like creamsicles to me!)
Description: A non-sticky, hydrating lip gloss made with vitamin-rich oils for juicy, semi-sheer color with a long-lasting high-shine finish.

Texture:
They’re marketed as a cross between a lip oil and a lip gloss, meaning they are more lightweight and less sticky than traditional glosses. To me, these are quite thin, but they do a have a tiny amount of grip, meaning they don’t slip around too badly, but they’re just not cushiony or smoothing in the way I usually like lip gloss to be. I’d almost describe them as a cross between a lip oil and a lip serum because they’re thin, buttery, and lightweight.

What I LOVE about these is the way my lips feel when they wear off. My lips feel super soft and hydrated, and like there’s a bit of an oil left behind. I definitely agree with the claims that it’s a hydrating gloss!

These would be best suited for someone who wants a lightweight lip oil that barely feels like anything on the lips and leaves behind a hydrated feeling. 🤟🏻

894,3,0.0,False,9.0,476.0,"✨ For Fans of Centella Asiatica Extract: Meet THE PLANT BASE AC Clear Moisture Cica Cream! ✨

YesStyle Code: BEAUTYKAT321

This cream contains 76% Centella Asiatica, providing refreshing moisture for combination skin affected by environmental damage.

Centella Asiatica Extract is known for soothing dry, red, irritated, or inflamed skin. It has been used for thousands of years in India as an anti-aging remedy. 🌟

But that’s not all! This cream also features:

🍵 Green Tea Powder - Rich in vitamins A and C to protect and keep your skin healthy.

🌿 Tea Tree - Known for its potent sterilizing effects, 12 times stronger than other plants.

My Experience:
If you’ve seen my previous post, you know that I’ve been dealing with acne on my jawline, possibly due to hormonal changes. This cream has been a lifesaver, and thanks to The Plant Base for sending me several products to try. So far, I love using it alongside my other skincare products. Here’s my routine:

☀️ AM:
1) After cleansing and toning, I apply a spot treatment with 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide.
2) Apply The Plant Base AC Clear Cica Gel (72% Centella Asiatica) to my cheek area to reduce redness.
3) Apply The Plant Base AC Clear Moisture Cica Cream to my face and neck.
4) Finish with sunscreen.

🌙 PM:
1) Same as AM routine.
2) Apply The Plant Base Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid.
3) Apply The Plant Base AC Clear Moisture Cica Cream.

🍀 When using the Cica Gel and Cica Cream, apply them in thin layers to avoid any white, rubbery residues on your hairline.

⚠️ For those with dry & sensitive skin, you might skip the Cica Gel (NOT the cream) which contains alcohol, and use The Plant Base Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid instead.

The Plant Base AC Clear Moisture Cica Cream has a subtle herbal scent due to essential oils, which doesn’t irritate my eyes, though it gives a brief tingling sensation that disappears quickly. I can even use the Cica Cream under my eyes.

My skin feels well-hydrated and calm, with reduced redness and improved acne. I do feel a bit oily in the morning, but Hong Kong’s humid weather contributes to that.

Have you tried The Plant Base? What do you think about it?

🔴 Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!

I have been using Jumiso for almost a month and I truly love the 🐌 snail essence, 🐌 snail peptide cream, and all the 🍊 Vitamin C serums. 🥰 However, I feel skeptical about Jumiso Pore-Purifying Salicylic Acid Foaming Cleanser 🫧. I don’t like face cleansers that contain AHA and Salicylic Acid (BHA) as I worry that these ingredients will dry out my dehydrated skin and irritate my eyes.

But I am wrong! 😅 Jumiso Pore-Purifying Salicylic Acid Foaming Cleanser is so gentle that I can use it daily. It contains 0.5% Salicylic Acid and Blue Clay which help to exfoliate dead skin cells to reveal radiant and glowing skin.

I like how it cleans my skin and helps me to draw the impurities on my nose. As you see in the reel, I didn’t use any gadget to remove the excess sebum on my t-zone area but this cleanser is so effective! My skin feels fresh and smooth as this low-pH cleanser gently exfoliates the skin and unclogs pores.

It also contains 🍎 Apple Fruit Extract and 🌿 Coptis Japonica Root Extract for soothing and brightening benefits while keeping the skin’s moisture level. The non-comedogenic formula is suitable for all skin types too.

The only downside of this cleanser is that, it is not designed for eye areas so I will use another face cleanser in the evening after removing my makeup.

It might sting a bit, but the tightened, refreshed skin that’s to come makes it well worth it. We typically recommend that you come in for this treatment 2-3 times a year, followed by maintenance as needed. Our patient also had some deep microneedling RF prior to the plasma pen. We often combine this procedure with fillers, threads and of course, the REFIT EYE serum from EMER SKIN. It’s time to give your eyes some love.

This patient had been dealing with deep acne scars for years, but after seeing my work on social media, she knew exactly who to trust. I'm known for my unmatched expertise in subcision, and for her, I took it a step further—customizing a multi-treatment approach to plump those scars, build collagen production and create smooth, healthy skin.

I combined subcision with Sculptra to kickstart collagen production, used Bellafill to lift and fill in the scars, and hit every layer with laser resurfacing—Halo for broad improvement and Profractional for deep remodeling. The results? INSANE. Initially, she had swelling and scabs, but within a week, they were gone—revealing fresh, baby-smooth skin. She was blown away by how much her skin transformed after just one treatment.
 
I improved those scars like bing bop boom boom boom bop bam!  

And while acne scars aren’t a one-and-done fix, this was the perfect first step toward long-term results.

💥 DON’T FORGET THE SKINCARE 💥
I set her up with a powerhouse regimen featuring the best of @emer.skin, ensuring her skin heals fast while staying hydrated, bright, and glowing. Post-treatment care is everything—because I don’t just treat scars, I transform skin.

1176,0,60.0,False,1600.0,89900.0,"The @urbandecaycosmetics Face Bond Self-Setting Waterproof Foundation is EVERYTHING.

Website description: “Ultra-thin, medium coverage foundation with skincare benefits of a serum.”

The foundation is $40, comes in 40 shades shades, has a natural matte finish, medium-buildable coverage, ultra-thin texture, and a blurring effect. It’s waterproof, humidity proof, sweat proof, smudge and transfer resistant, and they specifically made shades for olive skin tone with their “chromium oxide green pigment.”

My thoughts:
I am extraordinarily picky about…well, everything… but especially foundation because I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin that gets oily in my t-zone no matter what I do.

This is the first foundation I’ve tried that keeps my skin matte while still looking like skin. It only started looking dry after 8 hours of wear, and that was on a day where I was super active and rubbing my face with a paper towel because I had to film a lot of lip swatches. I’m sure that on a normal day it would perform even better.

This might just be the best foundation for oily skin that I’ve ever tried.

Note: if you have dry skin, I would avoid this at all costs lol

I also prefer a glossy, hydrating lip stain formula like the Fenty poutsicle stain or the Romand juicy lasting tints.

Overall, I think it looks gorgeous but the formula could be greatly improved.

They’re $28 each (but you can get 20% off with my code KAIT20) and they have a subtle vanilla scent and a cooling metal applicator.

These are 100% accurately named because the texture is super lightweight and runny, almost like a liquid. Their description of these being a serum meets an oil with a shiny finish and non-sticky feel is spot on. 

Website Description:
“Pack on luminous glossy colour while hydrating your lips with our supercharged, Ceramide, and Peptide-rich, transformative lip hydra treatment balm. Backed by the latest European plant formulation—this cooling, non-sticky lip hydra balm boosts healing, keeps lips looking youthfully supple, and defends against moisture loss and everyday damage. Barrier-protecting Triple Lipid Complex enhances lip smoothness, natural Phytosterols fight flakes, and our best-in-class Peptide Complex stimulates collagen and volume for an elevated breakthrough in lip health with an unbeatable shine.”

People have asked me to compare these to the Lip Serums and they’re different every way. The lip serums aren’t very shiny, they’re more of a liquid lip balm with a semi-thick, gel cushion. I find the Lip Serums to be more nourishing on my lips, but if you like something shinier and more lightweight, I’d go for the Hydra-Balms.

My favorites are rosewood, glowgetter, and liv! I recommend using a lip liner for some structure unless you're only applying a small amount.

Anywho, the Saie dew bronze formula is great for dry skin! I LOVE the shade Salt, which looks like it would be pretty dark but the product is so sheer that it blends out easily on my light cool skin.

Unfortunately this formula fades extremely fast on me, but that’s because my face eats dewy products for lunch. My combination skin really needs base products with a natural or soft matte finish in order to last, so the Dewy Bronze will be best suited for dry skin!

This moisturizing balm, packed with plant-based oils, gives my lips a transparent and smooth watery glow without any stuffiness! 💧✨

My Experience:
I absolutely love it! 💕 I thought I’d prefer a J-Beauty brand like Canmake Muchi Puru Lip Tint, but rom&nd is more moisturizing with its lip oil effect and rich pigments. It keeps my lips hydrated all day (unlike some products that dry out my lips over time) and the colors are perfect for all complexions. It’s ideal for daily use! 🌸👄

Suggested Use:
Apply gently to the lip line. Use a small amount to avoid breaking the lipstick. 💋

Store in a place with little light exposure to prevent color change. Avoid high temperatures and freezing conditions. 🌞❄️

Which color would you choose? 🤔🎨

I'm having really good luck with this recent sunscreen order. Like a natural satin matte. At least I'm not super shiny and greasy throughout the day. My oily skin loves this. I can see this being a daily go-to. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Our patient was not fully satisfied with the appearance of her skin due to some irregular texture on her cheeks caused by acne scarring. To ambush her acne scars, we will be doing a combination treatment of CO2, plasma pen, and PRP- so we can get her skin looking smooth, refreshed, and radiant. As you can see with her amazing results, we were able to exceed her goal.

⚡️ ACNE SCAR COMBINATION
✅CO2
✅PLASMA PEN
✅PRP

No treatment is complete without EMER SKIN. Using our products post-treatment will enhance results to the absolute maximum.

*do these massages after skincare to reduce irritation
1. Double chin massage: tighten and lift skin near double chin area by pushing it up 
2. Face line massage: lift skin near face line using fingers for slimmer & contoured face
3. Use beauty device at home to more dramatically lift and sculpt face & neck lines. I’m using a radiofrequency device from Botem (product: r face) which is a kbeauty brand for homecare devices that’s popular in Korean beauty communities in Korea. It stimulates collagen and effectively contours jawline and neckline. Highly recommend💯

This can be worn alone, over or under makeup, mixed with foundation or as a highlighter.
In today’s reel I used as a foundation, under the @hauslabs Trichlone Skin Tech Foundation & the @dibsbeauty Desert Island Duo. This combo has become my go-to when I want a dewy, glow ✨ So far, this has felt lightweight and has not broken me out.

The red light wand smooths, de-puffs, tighten, soothes, renews, sculpts, tone & lifts. It warms up as you glide it on to the skin. The galvanic current improves ingredient absorption and moisture retention. Red light therapy smooths the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production. 
Since unboxing the #solawave wand, I’ve been using it for a week and I’ve gotta say, I’m impressed.

If you’re loving the glossy lip trend as much as I am, you need to pair it with a perfectly matched lip liner to achieve that full, natural, and feminine pout! 💄 Here’s my secret for a quick lip transformation:

✨ Step 1: Fill your lips with a glossy lip product to give them a plump, hydrated look.

✨ Step 2: Use a lip liner with a rounded tip to define your lip shape. Slightly overline for a fuller, softer vibe—don’t forget to keep the corners rounded for a youthful finish!

Personally, I prefer applying lip gloss before lip liner because it creates a softer, more natural look without forming a harsh line along my lips. But honestly, there’s no right or wrong way—just go with what works for you! 😊

💖 Here’s what I used in the reel:

🌹 Dusty Rose Combo: rom&nd Glasting Color Gloss in 04 Grapy Way + Kiko Milano Creamy Color Comfort Lip Liner in 03

🌸 Pink Combo: rom&nd Glasting Color Gloss in 01 Peony Ballet + Rimmel London Exaggerate Full Lip Liner in 063

🤎 Beige Combo: rom&nd Juicy Lasting Tint in 02 Nucadamia + rom&nd Lip Mate Pencil in 03 Kaya Beige

These combos are giving serious life to my lip game! The mix of juicy gloss and precise lining creates a natural, polished look that’s so on-trend. 🙌

1496,2,0.0,False,9.0,476.0,"💧🥰 Removing makeup while dissolving blackheads - AXIS-Y ay&me Biome Resetting Moringa Cleansing Oil ❤️

This cleansing oil from Korea really catches my eye and here are the reasons:

First, the design of the packaging is not in a typical K-Beauty style. I love how simple it is but the products still look expensive. 💵

Second, it contains 5 different prebiotics & probiotics for improving skin complexion. I will say it is a high-end, yet affordable skincare product.

🫧 So what is AXIS-Y ay&me Biome Resetting Moringa Cleansing Oil? And what does it claim to be?
AXIS-Y Made for Me By Me (ay&me) is a skincare series that AXIS-Y spent 2 years developing and this cleansing oil is one of the products from this line. It cleanses away makeup, excess sebum, whiteheads, and blackheads in ONE step so no double-cleansing is needed.

What do I think about this product?

😍 Pros:
It cleanses my makeup and dirt effectively and I just love how I feel after using it. My t-zone area feels so smooth and soft, which is like after using a peeling mask and all the blackheads are gone! I must say, it is so satisfying! 🥰

🕊️ The oil is weightless but it is still thicker than most of the cleansing oils that I’ve used. Having said that, it’s not greasy and it leaves a light hydrating finish. 💦

Talking about double-cleansing, I still use face cleanser after this cleansing oil because old habits die hard. 😅 Remember to use it on dry face and dry hands, massage your face, and add water to emulsify. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.

🤨 Cons:
It has a Chinese herbal and sandalwood scent. 🪵 It doesn’t irritate my skin but I have sensitive eyes which I don’t feel very comfortable with.

📖 For the functions of the ingredients, please refer comment for details 💕

1582,30,0.0,False,8.0,299.0,"*Korean Glass Skin: The Ultimate Skincare Trend*

Korean beauty (K-beauty) has taken the global beauty industry by storm, and one of its most iconic trends is the concept of ""glass skin."" Glass skin refers to a complexion that is incredibly smooth, luminous, and translucent, much like a piece of glass. Achieving this flawless, dewy look is the result of meticulous skincare routines designed to nourish, hydrate, and perfect the skin over time.

At the heart of glass skin is the idea of healthy, well-hydrated skin. It’s not just about masking imperfections or covering up with makeup. Instead, glass skin emphasizes the importance of achieving beauty from within, using a combination of skincare products and techniques that focus on long-term results. The goal is a clear, even-toned complexion that reflects light effortlessly, giving the face a radiant, almost ethereal glow.

The Key Components of a Glass Skin Routine

Achieving glass skin involves a comprehensive skincare regimen, with a focus on hydration, exfoliation, and protection. Here are some key steps:

1. **Double Cleansing**: The first step in the glass skin routine is the K-beauty staple of double cleansing. This process involves using an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, followed by a water-based cleanser to thoroughly clean the skin. Proper cleansing is crucial for preventing breakouts and ensuring that the skin is prepared to absorb subsequent skincare products.

2. **Exfoliation**: Regular exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, promoting smoother and brighter skin. Gentle exfoliants like AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes work to unclog pores and refine skin texture without causing irritation, which is important for maintaining the smooth, clear base necessary for glass skin.

3. **Toning**: Korean toners are designed to hydrate and balance the skin’s pH, as well as prepare it to absorb serums and moisturizers. Hydrating toners, often infused with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water, deliver essential moisture to the skin, making it appear plump and fresh.

4. **Essences and Serums**: Essences are lightweight, hydrating liquids that help boost the skin’s moisture levels. Serums, on the other hand, are more concentrated and are used to target specific skin concerns such as hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or dullness. Layering these products is key to achieving the deep hydration that gives glass skin its signature reflective quality.

5. **Moisturizing**: A rich, hydrating moisturizer seals in all the previous layers of hydration. Look for moisturizers with humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which draw moisture into the skin, as well as emollients like ceramides and fatty acids to strengthen the skin barrier and lock in moisture.

6. **Sunscreen**: The final step, and perhaps the most important, is applying sunscreen. UV protection is critical to prevent sun damage, which can lead to premature aging and dull skin. Korean sunscreens are often lightweight and formulated to leave the skin looking dewy, adding to the overall glow.

Why Is Glass Skin So Popular?

The appeal of glass skin lies in its emphasis on natural beauty. Unlike makeup-heavy trends, it focuses on achieving a healthy, radiant complexion that doesn’t rely on cosmetics for coverage. Instead, it encourages a holistic approach to skincare that prioritizes hydration, nourishment, and protection. Moreover, the glow achieved with glass skin makes the face appear youthful, fresh, and vibrant — qualities that are universally desired.

Ultimately, glass skin is more than just a trend; it’s a lifestyle that promotes skincare as a form of self-care, teaching individuals to appreciate the beauty of healthy, well-maintained skin.

Our lovely patient is back for some maintenance facial sculpting. She is very beautiful, but has some areas she would like us to address- nothing a little bit of filler won't help. Her main concern is balancing her temples; we used a feathering technique to blend her temples while adding some volume as they were becoming hollow, plus we also elevated her brows making her eyes appear more open. We followed the temples with a bit of filler to the jowl area to achieve support, then targeted her nasolabial folds next leaving them softer and less visible. We saved the absolute best for last- her nose. Starting with a small amount of filler to her septum and working our way up the dorsum, we were able to completely transform her nose shape straightening it out. She is over the moon with her results and cannot get over how wonderful she looks!

Translucent tone up powder from @lauramercier 

1. Eyebrows (makes drawing brows easier and helps them last longer)
2. Eyes (similar to brows, makes eye makeup application easier and prevents it from smudging)
3. Smile lines (mattifying smile lines can make you look younger because powder adds subtle volume especially if you use lighter shades)
4. Sides of nose (lots of sebum and pores there -tends to look messy; we only want to focus on highlighting the bridge for dimensional look)
5. Face line (powder outer parts of face to avoid hair from sticking)

The added bonus of SPF 30 is a nice perk too ☀️

It's $34 which feels a little steep to me but I really adore the formula.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this tinted hybrid sunscreen from Supergoop today!
🔆
- UV Filters: Zinc Oxide, Homosalate, and Octisalate
- It has a cream texture 
- 14 shades for a wide range of skin tones
- I did not get pilling
- Has a radiant finish
- No added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $44 for 35mL. Can be purchased from their website or Sephora.
🔆
With the amount of coverage and the price, I would say to treat this like a foundation instead of a sunscreen. You can apply the proper amount needed for a sunscreen and it doesn't look bad, but still. Since it has coverage to it, I'm not applying on my neck and beard, etc. I still use my regular sunscreen underneath. Nice product though. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

From use I’ve noticed:
☀️ smoother feeling skin without the heavy feel of dimethicone
☀️ clear SPF = no white cast, this’ll work on all skin tones!
☀️ wears nicely under makeup without affecting its performance/wear
☀️ says its a Demi-matte finish, but it pulls glowy on me
☀️ doesn’t feel heavy over the skin upon application or throughout the day
Have you tried a clear SPF, if so, let me know which one in the comments below 👇🏼 💭 || #murad #muradskincare #spf #clearspf #clearcoat #clearcoatspf #giftedbymurad

Some takeaways:
🍉 Love the lightweight feel of this serum.
🍉 Blends easily and effortlessly. No streaks detected.
🍉 To compare, Dew Drops (original, best selling formula) gives the skin a dewy finish (which I love) Hue Drops give the skin a sheer, warm glow.
I used this on Saturday & immediately noted that my pores appeared smaller the next day. On Sunday, this wore nicely under makeup. The sheer, warm glow peeked through a medium to full coverage foundation.

She found me on social media, loved my approach to natural, undetectable aesthetics, and knew she wanted only the most skilled hands to help restore balance and harmony to her features! 

The goal? To enhance her beauty in a way that feels completely authentic to her, without it being obvious she had anything done. Here’s how I did it:
✔️ Temples, cheeks, chin, and jawline: These areas were treated to restore lost volume, create subtle definition, and enhance her natural structure. The result? A sculpted look that complements her features beautifully, without looking overdone.
✔️ Lips: Instead of focusing on volume, we refined the shape of her lips to make them even more dynamic and balanced with her overall appearance.

After just a few days, her swelling went down, and she couldn’t believe how flawless and seamless her transformation looked. I mean, how amazing does she look? You can literally see her glowing from the inside out! Her friends have noticed her glowing confidence, but no one can pinpoint why—and that’s the magic of undetectable aesthetics.

The result? A face that looks effortlessly youthful, balanced, and refreshed:
✅ A perfectly sculpted jawline.
✅ High, defined cheekbones.
✅ Beautifully shaped lips.

Because true artistry isn’t about changing who you are—it’s about enhancing what’s already there, in a way that feels entirely natural. That's why you come to the best!

Korean beauty (K-beauty) has taken the global beauty industry by storm, and one of its most iconic trends is the concept of ""glass skin."" Glass skin refers to a complexion that is incredibly smooth, luminous, and translucent, much like a piece of glass. Achieving this flawless, dewy look is the result of meticulous skincare routines designed to nourish, hydrate, and perfect the skin over time.

At the heart of glass skin is the idea of healthy, well-hydrated skin. It’s not just about masking imperfections or covering up with makeup. Instead, glass skin emphasizes the importance of achieving beauty from within, using a combination of skincare products and techniques that focus on long-term results. The goal is a clear, even-toned complexion that reflects light effortlessly, giving the face a radiant, almost ethereal glow.

The Key Components of a Glass Skin Routine

Achieving glass skin involves a comprehensive skincare regimen, with a focus on hydration, exfoliation, and protection. Here are some key steps:

1. **Double Cleansing**: The first step in the glass skin routine is the K-beauty staple of double cleansing. This process involves using an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, followed by a water-based cleanser to thoroughly clean the skin. Proper cleansing is crucial for preventing breakouts and ensuring that the skin is prepared to absorb subsequent skincare products.

2. **Exfoliation**: Regular exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, promoting smoother and brighter skin. Gentle exfoliants like AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes work to unclog pores and refine skin texture without causing irritation, which is important for maintaining the smooth, clear base necessary for glass skin.

3. **Toning**: Korean toners are designed to hydrate and balance the skin’s pH, as well as prepare it to absorb serums and moisturizers. Hydrating toners, often infused with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water, deliver essential moisture to the skin, making it appear plump and fresh.

4. **Essences and Serums**: Essences are lightweight, hydrating liquids that help boost the skin’s moisture levels. Serums, on the other hand, are more concentrated and are used to target specific skin concerns such as hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or dullness. Layering these products is key to achieving the deep hydration that gives glass skin its signature reflective quality.

5. **Moisturizing**: A rich, hydrating moisturizer seals in all the previous layers of hydration. Look for moisturizers with humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which draw moisture into the skin, as well as emollients like ceramides and fatty acids to strengthen the skin barrier and lock in moisture.

6. **Sunscreen**: The final step, and perhaps the most important, is applying sunscreen. UV protection is critical to prevent sun damage, which can lead to premature aging and dull skin. Korean sunscreens are often lightweight and formulated to leave the skin looking dewy, adding to the overall glow.

Why Is Glass Skin So Popular?

The appeal of glass skin lies in its emphasis on natural beauty. Unlike makeup-heavy trends, it focuses on achieving a healthy, radiant complexion that doesn’t rely on cosmetics for coverage. Instead, it encourages a holistic approach to skincare that prioritizes hydration, nourishment, and protection. Moreover, the glow achieved with glass skin makes the face appear youthful, fresh, and vibrant — qualities that are universally desired.

1️⃣ Hydration is key! 💦 Layer up humectants like glycerin, panthenol, & beta-glucan to keep your skin quenched.

2️⃣ Don’t forget ceramides, cholesterol, & fatty acids—your skin barrier NEEDS them! A weak barrier = dehydration & irritation.

3️⃣ And for the ultimate skin hack? Slug it! 🐌 Occlusives like petrolatum & dimethicone lock in hydration overnight for a strong, healthy glow. ✨

#GiftedByEsteeLauder

People have been raving about the Estee Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation, and I finally got to try it! 😍 It did not disappoint! After testing it for a solid 9 hours, including jogging and having dinner with my besties, my makeup stayed fresh. 💃🏽

My Experience:

There was slight oiliness on my t-zone after jogging but the makeup was still perfectly in place! I simply pressed a tissue on my t-zone to absorb the oil, and — no joke — my makeup didn’t budge! 💪🏽 No cakiness, no oxidation, and I didn’t even use a compact for touch-ups. It lasted flawlessly until late evening! 🌙

Not only did the foundation survive the 9-hour challenge, but it also exceeded my expectations! Truly a fan favorite and the #1 prestige foundation in the US in 2023! 🇺🇸

Product Information:

- Available in over 55 shades 🌈, so you’re bound to find your perfect match!
- 24-hour wear ⏳ for a flawless, natural matte finish 🖌️
- Breathable, lightweight cashmere matte finish 💨
- Coverage: Medium-to-full, buildable 🖤
- Features: Sweat-proof, humidity-proof, waterproof, and transfer-resistant 🏃‍♀️🌧️
- Controls oil all day, no caking or creasing ✨

My Tips: 💧 I wet my makeup sponge, squeeze out the excess water, and gently press the foundation onto my skin for an even, flawless finish. Then, set my makeup with loose powder.

👀 For the delicate under-eye area, I spray a hydrating mist on a brush, pick up a small amount of loose powder, and gently press it in after using Estée Lauder foundation.👌🏽

Our patient had suffered severely from her acne scars that she'd carried for years and finally felt ready to do something about them. She saw us on social media and felt confident coming to us because she knew we were the masters of the subcision technique. In addition to subcision, we treated her scars with sculptra to increase collagen production, bellafill to lift the scars and subcise them, Halo, our hybrid fractional laser to attack the scars on multiple levels, and lastly, our profractional laser to penetrate deep and remodel the scars. 
     Initially, she was very swollen, but after about a week, the swelling vanished and so did her scabs, revealing smooth, baby skin. She was completely blown away by how effective just one treatment was, but in order for her scars to keep improving, she will require more rounds. Acne scars are always a process, not a one stop treatment. 
     DON'T FORGET SKINCARE
     We sent our patient home with a meticulously crafted skincare regimen that included the bulk of the @emer.skin line of products. These not only help her heal the proper way, but they also hydrate and brighten the skin so that it looks radiant and healthier than ever post-treatment.

Through seeing the changes we were able to make in our patients' lives through the services that we offered and our partners, she took matters into her own hands. To start her weight loss journey she did a COSMETIC SLEEVE which helps to shed weight quickly. Once she got to a lower weight, she wanted to fine tune her results and get to where she actually wanted to be which entailed using SEMAGLUTIDE and CJC that we use for patients to help them lose weight, live a healthier lifestyle, and even prepare for GLADIATOR or SUPERMODEL LIPO.

✅ SEMAGLUTIDE
✅ CJC
✅ COSMETIC SLEEVE

👨🏻‍⚕️My approach is unique as we address both the internal components to healing and aging along with our external treatments. To see truly remarkable changes long-term, a lifestyle modification is needed with diet and exercise as well as hormonal and/or peptide programs to enhance wellness, healing and longevity of life and final results.

The pop-up is located on 104 Prince St. in Soho. It features both new pieces from the recent collection as well as archival favorites. In the basement, there is a fun little movie to watch and there is also a room where you can bring your vintage Murakami pieces for repair. Unfortunately, the café has closed after the first two weekends. I waited about 30-40 mins to get inside but there was a virtual queue so I could grab some coffee in soho and relax while I waited.

When I visited this past week, the pop-up did have some of the products in stock, but not many. The only bag that was available was the neverfull. And then they also had some smaller products in stock, such as belts, dog collars, scarves, and sunglasses. For every product that you purchase, you get a token to use on the giant vending machine. You are able to win fun little prizes, like limited edition stickers and Tamagotchi.

If you are a Louis Vuitton Murakami collection lover like me, you will enjoy this little pop-up. However, given that there are very few items to purchase, and the café is closed, there’s not a ton to do for the long wait. I wish that they had more interactive activities or games as well as more archival pieces displayed along the new collection releases.",LOUIS VUITTON x MURAKAMI POP-UP NYC 🩷💚💜 #luxebags #fashion #louisvuitton,2257.0,0.04927947598253275,39,2025-01-21T18:32:39.000Z,3,False,0,1,0.00272919805244427,0.05535872453498671,False,True,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You don’t need a full face of makeup to create a dramatic and sophisticated look because the red lip does the heavy lifting.

It’s a timeless, classic look that requires minimal effort but always looks put-together. The simplicity of minimal makeup lets the boldness of the red lip shine, creating a striking and balanced effect.

Plus, red lipstick has a way of making you feel powerful and confident, even with little else on your face.

It’s a less is more approach that delivers maximum impact with minimal effort!

First thing first, this is my own experience, and skin care results can vary, depending on the skin condition, skin type, environment, and humidity. After all, the products I mentioned below may suit you better. 🙂

1️⃣ Mixsoon Bean Essence - This is a 2-in-1 facial essence that can be used as a moisturizing essence and exfoliating product. 🙁 Unfortunately, I didn’t see any dead skin rub off when I used it as an exfoliator and the hydrating result is just average. There are so many hydrating essences in the market and you can easily find one to replace it.

2️⃣ Anua Peach 77 Niacin Conditioning Milk - I loved it when I first used it but after using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks, I got breakouts here and there. 🙁 I thought it was my hormones but when I stopped using it, my skin was clear. I believe that this moisturizer is actually designed for dry skin and you can even layer it if you want extra moisturizing results, but it doesn’t suit my normal to dry, sometimes oily skin.

3️⃣ Caudalie Vinosource-Hydra Grape Water Gel Moisturizer - the fragrance contained in the product is too strong for my liking, and the product will peel off from the skin when I apply sunscreen or foundation after. 🙁

4️⃣ iT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Bags Daytime Treatment - this is a daytime under-eye treatment that delivers a temporary depuffing, tightening, and smoothing effect in 15 minutes. My problem is that this eye treatment is too tight and too dry for my skin and ironically, which is also their selling point to tighten and depuff eye bags. 🙁

After using it, I have more fine lines 👵 👀 around eye areas and I have to follow the product instructions every single step - too little is not enough, and too much will be peeling off! Need to use my fingertips to tab when applying, can’t smile or squint till it is dry, and use it after makeup. There are so many rules to follow. 🤯

😅 It may be my issue as the reviews of this product are good but it just doesn’t suit me.

Have you tried these products? Let me know your experience and share with us what products disappoint you 🙁.

I got many people asking me to do a try on or share my thoughts when I posted about getting this recently on my story. But the photo I posted last week is an old photo from when I got this back in December, so I've actually been using this for a while lol. Needless to say, I can say I love it (and the other Danessa Myricks Beauty products I've tried).
✨
Just showing here how I usually use it. I start off with priming using the Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder in Universal to help control my oils throughout the day, and then go into the Skin Tint. This tint is really nice on the skin. Looks very smooth with a nice natural glow. Can be a solid light/medium coverage option. There is more coverage when I use it with a brush, but I used a sponge this day. I follow up with a deeper shade of the Blurring Balm Powder for sort of bronze the perimeter of my face. After locking it in with a setting spray and powder, it's good to go.
✨
Let me know if you have any specific questions about my experience using it, but I'm loving it. It is very quick and easy to apply. It lasts well on me throughout the day, especially with the Blurring Balm Powder as a primer and proper setting after. Just helps to naturally elevate by evening out the appearance of my skin without being too full coverage.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Sunbum today!
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a silicone gel texture, feels lightweight
- No white cast on my skin tone, it's literally clear lol
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a satin matte finish
- No added fragrance
- Water resistant
- Doesn't stings my eyes
- Around $22 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers Target online.
🔆
This is indeed one of the best sunscreens I've tried in this category of clear silicone gel type sunscreens. I don't find this oil controlling much though, but it has that initial matte at least. This was a great purchase, and now I know it holds up with my other favorites in this category. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

🌟 The Medicube Exosome Cica Calming line is crafted for all skin types, especially those prone to irritation and breakouts. 

Thanks to Medicube for sending me this skincare series for an honest review! 🙌 I’ve been testing these lightweight products in high-humidity weather, and they’ve been perfect for my combo skin. Among them, the Exosome Cica Calming Ampoule stands out as my favorite. 💧 Its watery-gel texture rehydrates my skin beautifully, and I use it day and night after an AHA/BHA toner and before my acne treatment for a soothing effect. 🌱💖

🌱 What is Exosome Cica Calming Ampoule? This powerhouse ampoule uses Exosome Cica, a nano-sized ingredient with 5.3x the soothing power of traditional cica! It calms skin troubles, smooths texture, and provides long-lasting hydration with a refreshing, non-greasy feel. Perfect for AM or PM use! 🌅🌙

🌿 What are Exosome Cica Calming Toner Pads? Each pad provides a gentle swipe of hydration, balance, and skin-softening. Made with Tea Tree Leaf Water and Exosome Cica, these pads help with pore care and sebum control. 🧖‍♀️✨ 

My Experience: Convenient to use and leaves my skin feeling smooth! I’m still seeing if it will help with my large pores, but it’s a great addition to my routine.

💧 Exosome Cica Calming Cream: This cream offers up to 48 hours of hydration with a lightweight, non-sticky feel which is perfect for under makeup for a fresh, dewy look! 💦 It’s colorless, fragrance-free, and suitable for everyday use, especially for troubled or sensitive skin. 

My Experience: A gentle, calming moisturizer for all skin types! I love using it alongside my acne treatment for added hydration without any greasy residue. It’s a fantastic basic moisturizer for daily use! ✨

Key Ingredients:
🍀 Exosome Cica: 5.3x more soothing than regular cica
🍃 Tea Tree Leaf Water: Calms and hydrates troubled skin
🥰 Niacinamide: Brightens, strengthens, and reduces irritation

 1.Consult a Professional
Seek advice from a dermatologist, orthodontist, or plastic surgeon to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for facial asymmetry.
#ProfessionalConsultation #ExpertAdvice

 2.Understand Genetic Factors
Learn about how genetics play a role in facial asymmetry. It’s often hereditary, so understanding your family history can provide insights.
#Genetics #FamilyHistory

 3.Consider Orthodontic Treatment
Braces, retainers, or other orthodontic treatments can correct jaw alignment and improve facial symmetry over time.
#Orthodontics #JawAlignment

 4.Practice Facial Exercises
Certain facial exercises can strengthen and balance the muscles on both sides of your face, reducing asymmetry.
#FacialExercises #MuscleBalance

 5.Improve Your Posture
Poor posture can contribute to facial asymmetry. Work on standing and sitting straight to maintain an even facial structure.
#Posture #BodyAlignment

 6.Monitor Your Sleeping Position
Sleeping on one side can cause facial asymmetry. Try to alternate sides or sleep on your back to minimize this effect.
#SleepingPosition #SymmetryTips

7.Massage Therapy
Regular facial massages can improve blood circulation and help relax overactive muscles, contributing to a more symmetrical appearance.
#FacialMassage #BloodCirculation

8. **Consider Dermal Fillers
Non-surgical options like dermal fillers can be used to correct minor asymmetries by adding volume to specific areas of the face.
#DermalFillers #NonSurgicalTreatment

9.Surgical Options
For more severe cases, surgical procedures like rhinoplasty, jaw surgery, or chin implants may be considered to correct facial asymmetry.
#FacialSurgery #CorrectiveProcedures

10.Cosmetic Camouflage Techniques
Learn makeup techniques that help balance your facial features, enhancing symmetry with contouring and highlighting.
#MakeupTips #CosmeticCamouflage

11.Manage Environmental Factors
Sun exposure, facial injuries, and even habitual expressions can contribute to asymmetry. Protect your skin and be mindful of these factors.
#EnvironmentalFactors #SkinProtection

12.Accept and Embrace Your Unique Features
While improvement is possible, remember that a certain degree of asymmetry is natural and contributes to your unique beauty. Embrace it!
#SelfAcceptance #UniqueBeauty

Thanks to @stylevana_sv for sending me these products according to my travel schedule and my skin concerns. I really appreciate it! 🙌

Here’s what I got from Stylevana and my first impressions of them. Detailed reviews will be coming soon: 🏃‍♀️

✅ Torriden CELLMZING Firming Gel Mask - Beautiful pink packaging 🎀 and I can use it on my neck.

✅ Farm Stay Tea Tree Biome Calming Toner Pad - The toner 💚 is weightless and watery. The cotton pad has two different sides – one is smooth and the other is for exfoliation.

✅ Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream - Lightweight, easily absorbed, and super hydrating 💦.

✅ SOME BY MI Retinol Intense Advanced Triple Action Eye Cream - I’ve used the one in the old packaging. Great for deep wrinkles and dry skin. 💜

✅ Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++ - Smooth and hydrating 🌞. It reminds me of Haru Haru Wonder Black Bamboo Daily Soothing Sun Shield, but I need more time to test it.

1️⃣ Use a powder puff to gently press the outer corner of your eye, then slightly lift it.
2️⃣ Start drawing from the middle (or even the outer third) of your upper eyelid.
3️⃣ Extend the line from the inner corner of your eye.
4️⃣ Connect the dots and fill in any gaps.
5️⃣ Finally, extend the tail of your eyeliner for a flawless finish.

🖤 Product I Used: Wet n Wild Breakup Proof Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner — perfect for a sharp and smooth look!

Tip: Avoid blinking until the eyeliner is fully dry! 😉

If you haven't tried this formula, it's a thick, cushiony lip balm with great grip that coats the lips with nourishment. It has a pretty noticeable grape scent and the level of pigment depends on the shade you're getting. There isn't any smoothing quality but they're a nice shiny lip balm.

The only con to the Jello Gloss Balms is the shade range. There are 5 variations of pink, 1 clear, 1 clear with shimmer, 2 nudes, 1 plum, and 1 orange. We need berries, browns, reds, and beiges! 

(FYI the new shade Terracotta is actually a plum shade, not a terracotta color whatsoever.)

They're $18 but you can get 20% off with my code KAIT20 (affiliate code.)

If you want to see swatches of all of the original Jello Gloss Balms along with reviews of a ton of Girlactik products, you can watch my brand review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSN0FckS46w&t=260s

What she wants most is a more sculpted and defined jawline, that will give her the confidence to put her best face forward. We didn't stop there, though. We injected filler to her cheeks giving her natural contour, made her chin more projected and balanced, and elevated her brows making her eyes more open as the cherry on top. She's in love with her enhanced features and can now feel confident when taking all those selfies!

Noni might be a bit hard to find though, and ‪@celimax.global4695‬  ampoule is a great alternative if you want to give the ingredient a try (it contains very high percentage of noni!). The second method is drinking chamomile tea and storing it in the fridge to massage your inflamed skin✨ The last one is mung bean mask and you can see the detailed recipe in the related vid i linked!💕

Remember I posted a reel about the lavender jade gel nail design? Well, I finally found some time to finish shooting it, and it was so much fun! It may not be perfect, but the process was quite soothing and felt like a form of meditation as it completely occupied my mind. 🧘‍♀️✨

For this design, I only used a few gel nail polishes and purple glitters that I bought from Japan. You can easily find these products on several shopping platforms in the US. 

✅ Tips: Gel nail polishes in jello finish are recommended for this gemstone design. If you can’t find jello gel nail polish, mix regular gel nail colors with base gel and apply it to the nails with a brush. This will also create a semi-transparent effect. 💅🌟

😍 Steps by Steps of My Design:

1) Apply base gel, then 2-3 layers of jello gel polish (purple in this design) 💜

2) Apply glitters diagonally and cure them ✨

3) Apply top coat and cure it 💅

4) File the uneven surface and brush the surface to remove the dust 🖌️

5) Use a nail brush to apply a white line and blur it in one direction 🎨

6) Cure it and apply a top coat ✨

7) Re-apply the jello gel polish on partial areas to create an in-depth 3D effect 💎 

8) Finish it with top coat and cure it 

Will you try DIY gel nails at home? 💜💅

Our patient is a provider who works in the industry, so she is face to face with many people each day. Her acne scars have left her feeling insecure, so she's come to us to treat them. For her, we did a combination treatment consisting of our Halo hybrid fractional laser, Pixel8 Micro needling radio frequency, plus the AnteAGE exosomes to expedite her healing process. We crafted her a skin care regime to diligently follow- including the EMER SKIN Hydration mask as well as Hyla B. Now, she can finally get her confidence back and look her best while on the job. She is thrilled with how smooth and even her skin looks!  

No treatment is complete without EMER SKIN. Using our products post-treatment will enhance results to the absolute maximum.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this body sunscreen from Naked Sundays today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, and Octisalate
- It has a light lotion texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- Works well in my body hair
- Has a natural glowy finish (dry touch feel, but shimmers)
- No added fragrance or essential oils
- Around $34 for 100mL. Can be purchased from their website.
🔆
I assume that this would look good on a variety of skin tones and almost would give like a self tanner type of look if you have a lighter skin tone. It gives a glow to the skin without being greasy because it does sink in very well to the skin. You just get that glow and radiance from the golden shimmer. I almost wish that it did have a little bit of a sweet tropical scent like the other body sunscreen because this does seem like a special occasion, vacation type of vibe. I wouldn’t go sit on a white chair while wearing the sunscreen and honestly just because of that I probably would not repurchase this. I don’t have to be cautious of where I’m touching because of a tinted body product but I know that’s not the case for everyone. I know some people are totally cool with that. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

The cloud collagen balms are like a semi-matte lipstick meets a silky lip balm. They have some slip/creaminess to them that I really enjoy alongside really good grip. I would prefer if they came in a traditional lipstick bullet because they’re so pigmented but that’s a minor flaw.

The vegan lip liners are lovely, they are pretty sturdy so they stay in place really well but still have a creaminess to them, which I love. I don’t like lip liners that fully dry down so these are one of my favorite formulas.

Thanks to the @YesStyleInfluencers program for sending me the MacQueen Fake Up 3 Color Shading in Gray Brown for an honest review. I love light contouring to make my round face look slimmer in reels, and this powder is so blendable and versatile. It’s quickly become a must-have in my makeup routine! 🌟

💄 What I Love:
This contour powder features 3 shades you can either mix or use individually to define different parts of your face.
✨ Lightest shade: perfect for highlighting the upper cheeks.
✨ Medium shade: great for the nose, hairlines, and under blush.
✨ Darkest shade: ideal for chin definition.

The powder is super fine, buildable, and adheres beautifully thanks to the Skin Fit Power method — no fallout at all! 🙌 It gives a natural, mineral-powder finish that’s so easy to work with, even for contouring beginners. Use it right after loose powder for that 3D makeup look! 💯

It's all about sculpting and giving my patients the confidence to take on the world with a physique that reflects your hard work. I use the most advanced technology available such as Vaser and Renuvion with expert precision to deliver the most defined, athletic results possible.

Each treatment plan is meticulously customized to your unique anatomy and aesthetic goals. Whether you’re looking to enhance muscle definition or achieve a leaner, more chiseled look, I use the latest techniques like high-definition liposuction to carve out your abs, chest, arms, and back, creating a body that’s as strong as it looks.

For optimal results, I incorporate specialized fat-removal strategies that highlight muscle contours and deliver precise, natural-looking results. This not only refines the surface but also creates a more athletic, masculine appearance—perfectly suited for those aiming for that gladiator look.

What sets my practice apart is my deep understanding of different body types and how to approach each one for the best results. With over 15 years of experience in body contouring, I’ve perfected the art of achieving a balanced, proportional outcome that accentuates muscle definition without sacrificing a natural look.

I’ve performed thousands of procedures, sculpting stronger, more defined physiques for patients ready to live their most confident lives. Every body is unique, which is why I tailor each gladiator liposuction procedure to bring out the strongest, most refined version of you.


Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California.

1. I double cleanse every night but I skip a morning cleanse, now everyone is different so this may not work for some but I find that it helps my skin feel and look less dry while preserving my barrier. 
2. Exfoliating. This is a big one. I feel like the internet always tells us to exfoliate regularly but my skin doesn’t usually like it more than once in a while if I feel I need it. I always say go off of what your skin needs versus what the internet tells you. For me retinol helps me achieve smooth skin anyway so I don’t feel like I need it much. 

3. I use retinol every night, usually a retinal or even a gentle retinol. I prefer retinals since they have an encapsulated delivery method which keeps them stable and minimizes irritation. Since I have sensitive skin I usually use a sandwich method with moisturizer and really make sure I stick to a pea sized amount. I prefer using retinols over exfoliants because they achieve all of the same results and now that my skin is used to them, my barrier prefers it.",3 things that TRANSFORMED my skin ✨ (see description) #skintransformation,1326762.0,3.008530612244898,7,2024-06-11T20:07:33.000Z,1,False,0,0,0.08696805676177605,0.02890719744219578,False,False,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Grip is described as cool rose but on me it’s pretty warm. I wouldn’t wear it as a liner because the color is so bright and I prefer more muted / natural contour shades, but this is a gorgeous all-over-the-lips color. 

This formula is super creamy but sets in about 2 seconds and once it’s dry it does not budge. It’s not the kind of formula you can smudge - it will legitimately crumble off if you try to smudge it because it sets so fast. 

Because it has a budge-proof finish, it can feel a bit drying, so I like to add a gloss or balm on top.

These are $18 and the colors are “nipple matched,” which is apparently supposed to help you find your best color. 

You’re learning a lot about me here. but my nips are light pink and I definitely don’t want that as a lip liner color lol. Idk about that logic but maybe it works better for other skin tones.

Overall, at $18 this is a great long-lasting formula, I just wish they had some shades that were actually cool toned.

This serum is a powerhouse for anyone looking to boost skin elasticity and reduce dark spots while promoting a radiant glow. ✨ It’s been formulated with some seriously impressive ingredients:

- Rose PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide): A vegan-friendly option that combines Rosa Damascena Extract with Sodium DNA to restore your skin’s natural barrier and boost elasticity. 🌹💪

- 5 Types of Peptide Complex: Firm up your skin and reduce fine lines by boosting collagen production. 💖✨

- Niacinamide: Brightens your complexion, strengthens the skin barrier, and calms irritation. 🌟

- Adenosine: Smooths out fine lines and supports healthy skin structure. 🙌

- Holy Basil Extract: Soothes and protects your skin from irritation. 🍃

I’ve been pairing this serum with my Medicube Age-R Booster Pro to maximize the benefits. The milky, lotion-like texture is perfect for cooler, dry weather, and it helps the device glide smoothly over my skin. After just 10 minutes of treatment (5 minutes in Booster mode and 5 minutes in MC mode at Level 1), my skin feels soft, nourished, and glossy. 💦

Although it’s too early to see dramatic brightening results, I’m confident that with consistent use, my skin will look more radiant, thanks to the impressive before-and-after pictures on their website. 🌟

If you’re looking for a serum that combines cutting-edge ingredients with luxurious texture, this one’s a must-try!

Korean beauty (K-beauty) has taken the global beauty industry by storm, and one of its most iconic trends is the concept of ""glass skin."" Glass skin refers to a complexion that is incredibly smooth, luminous, and translucent, much like a piece of glass. Achieving this flawless, dewy look is the result of meticulous skincare routines designed to nourish, hydrate, and perfect the skin over time.

At the heart of glass skin is the idea of healthy, well-hydrated skin. It’s not just about masking imperfections or covering up with makeup. Instead, glass skin emphasizes the importance of achieving beauty from within, using a combination of skincare products and techniques that focus on long-term results. The goal is a clear, even-toned complexion that reflects light effortlessly, giving the face a radiant, almost ethereal glow.

The Key Components of a Glass Skin Routine

Achieving glass skin involves a comprehensive skincare regimen, with a focus on hydration, exfoliation, and protection. Here are some key steps:

1. **Double Cleansing**: The first step in the glass skin routine is the K-beauty staple of double cleansing. This process involves using an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, followed by a water-based cleanser to thoroughly clean the skin. Proper cleansing is crucial for preventing breakouts and ensuring that the skin is prepared to absorb subsequent skincare products.

2. **Exfoliation**: Regular exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, promoting smoother and brighter skin. Gentle exfoliants like AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes work to unclog pores and refine skin texture without causing irritation, which is important for maintaining the smooth, clear base necessary for glass skin.

3. **Toning**: Korean toners are designed to hydrate and balance the skin’s pH, as well as prepare it to absorb serums and moisturizers. Hydrating toners, often infused with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water, deliver essential moisture to the skin, making it appear plump and fresh.

4. **Essences and Serums**: Essences are lightweight, hydrating liquids that help boost the skin’s moisture levels. Serums, on the other hand, are more concentrated and are used to target specific skin concerns such as hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or dullness. Layering these products is key to achieving the deep hydration that gives glass skin its signature reflective quality.

5. **Moisturizing**: A rich, hydrating moisturizer seals in all the previous layers of hydration. Look for moisturizers with humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which draw moisture into the skin, as well as emollients like ceramides and fatty acids to strengthen the skin barrier and lock in moisture.

6. **Sunscreen**: The final step, and perhaps the most important, is applying sunscreen. UV protection is critical to prevent sun damage, which can lead to premature aging and dull skin. Korean sunscreens are often lightweight and formulated to leave the skin looking dewy, adding to the overall glow.

Why Is Glass Skin So Popular?

The appeal of glass skin lies in its emphasis on natural beauty. Unlike makeup-heavy trends, it focuses on achieving a healthy, radiant complexion that doesn’t rely on cosmetics for coverage. Instead, it encourages a holistic approach to skincare that prioritizes hydration, nourishment, and protection. Moreover, the glow achieved with glass skin makes the face appear youthful, fresh, and vibrant — qualities that are universally desired.

Ultimately, glass skin is more than just a trend; it’s a lifestyle that promotes skincare as a form of self-care, teaching individuals to appreciate the beauty of healthy, well-maintained skin.wellness journey, personal choices, body toaster, body image, increase awareness, health decisions, mental health, lifestyle choices, positive body image, self-care tips, toaster reviews, self help, mindfulness, personal growth, self love, mental wellness, self-love, health mindset, body positivity, wellness tips, mindful living, toaster hacks, amazon kitchen gadgets, kitchen gadgets, kitchen gadget, home appliances, toaster review, unique toasters, food ideas

Our patient had noticed the loss of volume in his face over time due to aging and weight loss. He couldn't stand how hollow his mid-face and under-eyes were looking. The good news is that he has excellent bone structure, making him the ideal candidate for facial sculpting. By injecting filler in his cheeks, under-eyes, and chin, we gave him a beautifully sculpted and symmetrical look. He was astounded by his results and even got several compliments the next day while at work. Everyone noticed how great he looked, but had no idea he had anything done. This is exactly what we strive for: contoured, yet natural. He was so happy that he decided to come to us, the masters of male facial sculpting.

MALE FACIAL SCULPTING:
✅ CHEEKS
✅ CHIN
✅ UNDER-EYES

✨ What it Does:
1️⃣ Quick Moisturizing: 89% Pennywort Extract, Allantoin, and 5-Cica protect sensitive skin from heat and external stimuli.
2️⃣ Instant Cooling: Essence-rich moisturizing clumping sheet offers an instant cooling effect.
3️⃣ Soothing Pack: Made of natural fabrics, it’s gentle on sensitive skin.

🗝️ Key Ingredients:
1️⃣ Pennywort Extract is known for its amazing skin-soothing properties. It deeply hydrates and calms irritated skin, making it perfect for those with sensitive skin.
2️⃣ Centella Asiatica Extract is traditionally used to improve small wounds and is also a well-known anti-inflammatory agent for eczema.
3️⃣ Allantoin is used in many skincare products to help moisturize and soothe skin irritation.

My Experience:
If you’ve been following me for some time, you may know that I am in love with DR.G Red Blemish Soothing Cream, but what wins my heart is DR.G Red Blemish Clear Quick Soothing Pads. ❤️

The pads are saturated with essence blended with Pennywort Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, and Allantoin for soothing and moisturizing. The pad is easy to tear into small pieces so that I can use them on the sides of my jaws. It deeply hydrates my skin and gives me an instant radiant result without feeling greasy. Use it daily for excellent hydrating results. 🥰

The Medicube Age-R Booster Pro ($288) is your new skincare BFF! 🌟 It goes viral for a reason - it has 4 modes for different skin care needs and today, I am going to use Booster Mode for boosting product absorption, and Micro Current (MC) Mode for skin firming.

I love pairing it with a Collagen Jelly Cream for that smooth glide, but feel free to use your favorite hydrating serum or a sheet mask! 🧖‍♀️

Unlike other skin care devices, they require using products without oil. For Medicube, you can use almost everything with it except aggressive skincare ingredients, such as AHA and Retinol, etc.

💫 For the Booster Mode, I started from level 1 and used it in a circular motion for 5 mins. Then, I switched to MC Mode and pulled my skin upward from the inside out for another 5 mins. I only used the device on one side of my face so you can see the before and after results.

After using it, my jawline and eyebrow are slightly lifted. 🥰 To prolong the skincare benefits, it is recommended to use the device 1-3 times a day but I won’t follow the recommendation as the device is too strong for frequent use, and it’s too time consuming. ⏳

Using this device with a cool sheet mask is more effective - my skin is softer and brighter, and the firming result is more obvious.

Thanks to @medicube_global_official and @medicube_us for sending me Medicube Age-R Booster Pro, I can see that I won’t visit beauty salons like I used to! By the way, should I make another reel for using Booster Pro with a facial sheet mask? Tell me what you think. 👇

Korean beauty (K-beauty) has taken the global beauty industry by storm, and one of its most iconic trends is the concept of ""glass skin."" Glass skin refers to a complexion that is incredibly smooth, luminous, and translucent, much like a piece of glass. Achieving this flawless, dewy look is the result of meticulous skincare routines designed to nourish, hydrate, and perfect the skin over time.

At the heart of glass skin is the idea of healthy, well-hydrated skin. It’s not just about masking imperfections or covering up with makeup. Instead, glass skin emphasizes the importance of achieving beauty from within, using a combination of skincare products and techniques that focus on long-term results. The goal is a clear, even-toned complexion that reflects light effortlessly, giving the face a radiant, almost ethereal glow.

   The Key Components of a Glass Skin Routine

Achieving glass skin involves a comprehensive skincare regimen, with a focus on hydration, exfoliation, and protection. Here are some key steps:

1.  Double Cleansing : The first step in the glass skin routine is the K-beauty staple of double cleansing. This process involves using an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, followed by a water-based cleanser to thoroughly clean the skin. Proper cleansing is crucial for preventing breakouts and ensuring that the skin is prepared to absorb subsequent skincare products.

2.  Exfoliation : Regular exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, promoting smoother and brighter skin. Gentle exfoliants like AHAs, BHAs, or enzymes work to unclog pores and refine skin texture without causing irritation, which is important for maintaining the smooth, clear base necessary for glass skin.

3.  Toning : Korean toners are designed to hydrate and balance the skin’s pH, as well as prepare it to absorb serums and moisturizers. Hydrating toners, often infused with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water, deliver essential moisture to the skin, making it appear plump and fresh.

4.   Essences and Serums: Essences are lightweight, hydrating liquids that help boost the skin’s moisture levels. Serums, on the other hand, are more concentrated and are used to target specific skin concerns such as hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or dullness. Layering these products is key to achieving the deep hydration that gives glass skin its signature reflective quality.

5.  Moisturizing : A rich, hydrating moisturizer seals in all the previous layers of hydration. Look for moisturizers with humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which draw moisture into the skin, as well as emollients like ceramides and fatty acids to strengthen the skin barrier and lock in moisture.

6. Sunscreen : The final step, and perhaps the most important, is applying sunscreen. UV protection is critical to prevent sun damage, which can lead to premature aging and dull skin. Korean sunscreens are often lightweight and formulated to leave the skin looking dewy, adding to the overall glow.

   Why Is Glass Skin So Popular?

The appeal of glass skin lies in its emphasis on natural beauty. Unlike makeup-heavy trends, it focuses on achieving a healthy, radiant complexion that doesn’t rely on cosmetics for coverage. Instead, it encourages a holistic approach to skincare that prioritizes hydration, nourishment, and protection. Moreover, the glow achieved with glass skin makes the face appear youthful, fresh, and vibrant — qualities that are universally desired.

* Gifted by YesStyle for Glow Up Giveaway Product

This is one of the lightest serums I’ve ever used! It’s not too light; the texture is just right for my combination skin. 

❓What are the benefits of APRILSKIN Pink Aloe Mucin Serum?

✨ Brightening Power: Packed with 20,000ppm of niacinamide and Vitamin C to tackle hyperpigmentation and give me a radiant glow.

🌿 Soothing Care: With 78% pink aloe vera and ceramide NP, it hydrates, calms, and beautifully repairs my skin barrier.

💧 Instant Results: I feel a cooling effect which gives me a sense of refreshing!

💥 Trouble Care: It helps to improve acne scars, red scars and dark scars - I have to use a bit longer to see the results.😅 Having said that, this lightweight, non-sticky formula is perfect for daily use, leaving my skin feeling fresh, well hydrated and not greasy at all! 🌟

I absolutely love the luscious texture of these new lip oils, and how moisturized my lips feel even after the shine and color have worn away. I like that they have been released in a beautiful array of shades from very light and subtle to more vibrant. The shade I wear the most is Milla, a deep sugary plum! Perfect for fall. My second fave is Lily, a sour cherry red 🍒

I recently bought some makeup products from Japan, and CANMAKE is one of them. This brand won me over as it offers a spectrum of high-quality makeup products at affordable prices with kawaii packaging. 🌸✨

I bought CANMAKE Muchi Puru Tint in:

01 Butterscotch 🍬

02 Peach 🍑

03 Wine Berry 🍇

05 Fig Puree 🎈

Thanks to the hydrating and moisturizing agents - Petroleum, Hyaluronic Acid, Collagen, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Honey, and Shea Butter - this lip tint provides a hint of cooling sensation, it also moisturizes my lips for long hours without feeling sticky.

The texture is soft, easy to glide on the lips, and won’t bleed. The color stays on the lips and conceals vertical lip lines, and most importantly, they are free from Fragrance, Parabens, Alcohol, and Silicone. How cool is that? 🤩

🤔 Although the product is called a lip tint, the color is not long-lasting, and you have to re-apply it after drinking and eating. It doesn’t bother me much, but it might for some people.

Will I repurchase it? I definitely will. 💖

The most common case that we use lasers in is for acne scars, but we also often use lasers for anti-aging purposes in order to revitalize the skin. There is undoubtedly a risk when it comes to treating patients with darker skin tones, but here at our practice, that risk is heavily mitigated due to our years of experience in treating all kinds of skin types. From skin type 1 to skin type 6, we don't shy away from treating any patient. This is because we are well-versed in the many different ways to treat different skin types. Make no mistake, laser treatments are not one size fits all. Some lasers that are excellent for fairer skin types are incredibly dangerous for darker ones. The improper use of a laser on a darker skin type can result in a burn or other unwanted pigmentation. It is an absolute MUST that you go to someone experienced who knows exactly how to treat darker skin types if you have dark skin.
We specialize in the use of many lasers such as Halo, CO2, Profractional, Aerolase, Fraxel, and more! We are at the top of our field in safely treating acne scars or even just rejuvenating the skin with lasers.

ALWAYS IN LA
Even while Dr. Emer is traveling to Miami and NYC from February 8-17, Neisha the PA will still be available to treat patients in Los Angeles. Book with her today!

Acne scars are more than just a skin issue—they absolutely crush the confidence of my patients. This patient came to me feeling frustrated and self-conscious about his stubborn acne scars. They not only affected his appearance, but they also stopped him from feeling his best. 

My approach was to use a combination treatment to address both the texture and pigmentation. I used TCA Cross, Halo laser, and CO2 laser to resurface and regenerate the skin. Each of these treatments is a powerhouse on its own, but combined, they worked MAGIC to improve the look and feel of his skin.
We also incorporated the Glacial Glide in combination with AnteAGE Exosomes and EMER Skin for advanced healing and skin regeneration, ensuring that the results would not only be effective but long-lasting.

 His scars are noticeably smoother, the discoloration has dramatically faded, and his skin is looking healthier than ever. But the real win is in how he feels now—his confidence has been fully restored. He’s now able to look in the mirror and see a fresh, clear complexion that allows him to feel like his BEST self.

Our patient recently came to us for a surgical procedure where we removed his buccal fat pads in order to get him a slimmer look in his cheeks. We also performed some neck lipo on him in order to achieve a snatched jawline. Now that he has healed, he's back to build upon those results with some radiesse filler to his midface, jawline, and chin. The previous procedure is going to enable his filler to really pop so he was excited to see his results. Once everything settled, he was extremely satisfied with the sharper, more angular look we gave him. It was exactly what he envisioned when he came to us and he could not be happier.

YesStyle.com Reward Code 👉 BEAUTYKAT321 👈 

I am using 🥰 Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner 🥰 which is a light, hydrating, and refreshing toner packed with fermented ingredients, such as 🌾 Rice Extracts, 🎋 Panax Ginseng Root Extract and 💦 Hyaluronic Acid. I love how it softens and smooths my skin right after a single application. It also helps skin absorption for subsequent use of essence, serum, and moisturizer.

I brought the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner for my recent Thailand trip. My friend and my husband loved it! They both have dry skin so I encourage them to use it generously after sunbathing. They splashed the toner onto their palm and patted it on the skin. It is great for rehydrating thirsty and sun-damaged skin and you can see the result instantly.

After the toner, I use Vitamin C serum and then layer with 🥰 Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Facial Oil 🥰 which is a lightweight facial oil for amazing fast-absorbing, and skin moisturizing results. I have normal to dry skin so sometimes, I need facial oil to replenish my skin’s natural moisture. I like Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Facial Oil as it is easy to spread out and absorb. It creates a dewy, glassy skin finish without feeling heavy which is simply amazing. 

I also use this facial oil on the neck and body, and if the weather is too dry, I will mix it with my regular moisturizer or body lotion for extra nourishment. The best part is that I can use it after snail mucin essence or other serums to boost the skincare benefits and repair the skin barrier. It contains 🌾 45% Rice Bran Oil, 🌻 Sunflower Seed Oil, 🪻 Lavender Oil, and 🍃 Jojoba Oil so you can also use it as a massage oil for relaxing.

The only complaint I have is the scent of this facial oil. It is Lavender but I think it is a bit too strong for my liking. Having said that, it doesn’t irritate my skin at all and I can even apply it to my under-eye areas (use it cautiously if you have sensitive eyes).

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this body sunscreen from Coola today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a lotion texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- Works well in my body hair
- Has a natural glowy finish with a dry touch feel
- No added fragrance but they have scented versions
- Water and sweat resistant
- Around $28 for 148mL. Can be purchased from their website, sephora, or ulta.
🔆
I loved their spray version of this and this is just as good. Water resistance is super important for a body sunscreen for me and it didn't start breaking down easily with sweat. This could be a good option to make sure you're getting good even coverage compared to the spray. This also comes in SPF 30, 50, 70, and scent options. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Just two items. October and November were tough to navigate and the last thing I could think of what adding things to cart that I wanted. I knew I needed a restock on both. I picked up a new shade of the foundation and stuck to the same concealer shade. I love a lighter concealer to brighten my dark under eyes. What I love about the foundation is the coverage, it’s lightweight and it blends easily with just fingers! #hauslabsfoundation #hauslabs #hauslaboratories #ladygaga #hauslabslooks #hauslabsmakeup #sephora #makeup

He had a vision of those hulking, super defined arms and he just wasn't able to achieve them with just his dedicated work in the gym. So, we went to work and carefully sculpted them out while grafting fat to his shoulders in order to round them. Many doctors are unwilling to perform liposuction in this area, as the anatomy is very delicate and requires only the utmost knowledge and skill. He chose us based on the high amount of results we post on our socials, so he felt extremely comfortable trusting us. We know the exact area to sculpt and were able to really define each critical area of his arms: his biceps, triceps, deltoid, and the shoulders. This latter portion was done by harvesting his fat, purifying it, and then grafting it into the shoulders in order to athletically round them, creating immaculate balance with his arms. ​We did more than just his shoulders and arms.
     IT DOESN'T END WITH SURGERY
He got stellar results from his procedure, but he wanted to get the absolute most out of it. So, he participated in our after care protocol which involved hyperbaric therapy, lymphatic massages, and IV therapy.  He also made sure he was eating right, working hard in the gym, and taking PEPTIDES such as MK-677 and CJC for muscle growth and growth hormone production. This stands as an excellent example of a patient who put in the work post-surgery to truly capitalize on and maximize his results.


POST-OPERATIVE HEALING INCLUDES:
 Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
 Lymphatic massages
 IV NAD+ therapy
 Emerage scar skincare protocol
 Peptide and hormonal optimization

We typically recommend that you come in for this treatment 2-3 times a year, followed by maintenance as needed. 

Our patient also had some deep microneedling RF prior to the plasma pen. We often combine this procedure with fillers, threads and of course, the REFIT EYE serum from EMER SKIN.

Most folks think that if they don't feel irritation within 24hrs of applying a retinoid, they are in the safe zone. But did you know retinoids can cause a delayed irritation response that is felt up to 3 days later?😳

👉This tip mostly applies to folks new to the retinoid game or those increasing the strength of their current retinoid.

Thanks to @medicube_global_official for sending me several products for review, including these best-selling moisturizers I’ve long wanted to try!

Now, the questions are, which one should we use, and what’s the best price we can get online? I’ve laid out the differences between these moisturizers below, and you can enjoy the discounted prices on Prime Day. 🎉

🌸 What is Medicube Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream? It’s a hydrating and anti-aging cream designed to improve skin elasticity and moisture levels.

🌸 Key Ingredients
* Collagen
* Niacinamide
* Hyaluronic Acid
* Peptides

🌸 Skincare Functions
* Boosts skin elasticity
* Provides deep hydration
* Reduces fine lines and wrinkles
* Improves saggy skin

💛 What is Medicube Deep Vita C Capsule Cream? It’s an innovative skincare product that combines a transparent gel with Vitamin C capsules to deliver a fresh, potent dose of Vitamin C with each use.

💛 Key Ingredients
* Vitamin C
* Hyaluronic Acid
* Ceramides
* Niacinamide

💛 Skincare Functions
* Brightens complexion
* Evens skin tone
* Reduces hyperpigmentation
* Provides antioxidant protection

🌸 🤔  What do I think about Medicube Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream? It’s more suitable for dry skin with aging concerns. I love using it as a sleeping pack to seal in my natural skin’s moisture, especially when the air-con is on overnight. I wake up with soft, glowy & hydrated skin. I use it 2-3 times a week or as needed.

💛 🤔 What do I think about Medicube Deep Vita C Capsule Cream? This cream feels like an advanced skincare product straight from the future! I love playing around with the transparent gel and Vitamin C capsules.

      Penile enhancement is a very delicate procedure, and should always be done by the most qualified and experienced providers. Here at Emer Male Clinic, we have been performing penile enhancement for over ten years, with literally thousands of treatments under our belts. We offer a variety of treatment types from penis filler, Bocox, P- Shot, Scrotox, and Shockwave therapy. These treatments are not only aimed at increasing the size and girth of the penis, but also assist in enhancing elements like stamina, intensity of orgasms, and smoothness. 
     The consultation process is made to be as comfortable as possible and can be done virtually or in-person. Any questions patients may have before, during, or after the procedure will be answered by Dr. Emer and/or his treatment coordinators. 

Did you know that this does not only increase size and girth, but can increase your stamina if we also inject EXOSOMES and STEM CELLS?

Treatment does not only increase the shaft of your penis but can also increase the head size. BOTOX can be used to make the scrotum hang lower — AKA SCROTOX.

Notes:
Pink Pineapple, Palm Leaves, Coconut Water
Wild Jasmine, Plumeria, Lily of the Valley
Tree Moss, Salted Woods, Sweet Amber Woods, Vanilla

At first, I get a burst of pineapple but that quickly fades into three distinct notes: coconut, florals, and a salty, woody accord.

Miami Nectar is described as a gourmand but I smell the florals just as much as I smell coconut and salted and amber woods, so it’s quite balanced! If you’re not a gourmand lover, don’t let that scare you off.

Longevity is on the lighter side but I don’t mind reapplying.

Overall, I’d say Miami Nectar is my second favorite perfume from Ellis Brooklyn. Nothing could ever beat my love of Sun Fruit, it’s my signature warm weather scent!

🔴 Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!

I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

My patient came to me with deep frustration over her scars, and like many others, it was affecting her confidence in a big way. This is her second treatment with me, and I’m thrilled to see how far she’s come.

For her, I used a combination of TCA Cross, Halo laser, and CO2 resurfacing—treatments that I’ve perfected over the years to address every layer of scarring. It’s not just about picking the right treatments—it’s about knowing exactly how to use them to get safe, effective results. I see a lot of people who go to less experienced providers and don’t get the results they’re hoping for. When it comes to acne scars, you need someone who understands the nuances of different skin types and how to treat them safely and effectively. That’s what I bring to the table with every patient.

This case is a perfect example of why expertise matters. The wrong treatment or technique can lead to complications like hyperpigmentation or underwhelming results, but with my experience, I’ve been able to safely deliver remarkable improvement. But no treatment is complete without proper aftercare. I always recommend my patients use my EMER SKIN products post-procedure to maximize their results. It’s a crucial step in reducing downtime, supporting the healing process, and ensuring that their skin continues to improve long after the treatment is done.

If you’re dealing with acne scars, don’t settle for less than an expert. I’ve spent years honing my techniques to give my patients the best possible outcome. Your skin deserves nothing less.

Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California.

4361,5,0.0,False,23.0,476.0,"Will you choose a toner pad with a higher price or a cheaper one? 🤔

Let’s compare K-Beauty brands, the Medicube Zero Pore Pad 2.0 and the Farmstay Tea Tree Biome Calming Toner Pad. Both contain acids, AHA and PHA respectively, that improve skin texture, target large pores, and exfoliate the skin. 🌟

1️⃣ Medicube Zero Pore Pad

Removes excess oil and impurities while exfoliating the skin to improve large pores.
Dual-textured pads infused with Salicylic Acid (BHA) and AHA, plus patented pore care ingredients to exfoliate dead skin cells, clear sebum, and minimize pores.

2️⃣ Farmstay Tea Tree Biome Calming Toner Pad

Contains PHA, which has a larger molecular structure than AHA, making it gentler on the skin.

Infused with Tea Tree Leaf Oil and Extract to hydrate and calm the skin while maintaining oil-water balance.

😌 What do I think about these toner pads?

Medicube:
✅ Better oil control.
✅ Contains more essence, so one pad is enough for the face, neck, and collar areas.
🚫 Not suitable as a mini face mask as it can dry out the skin.
🚫 Higher price: $17 on Amazon, $20.8 on Stylevana, and $27 on YesStyle.

Farmstay:
✅ Gentler on the skin with soothing ingredients.
✅ Offers light hydration.
✅ Can be used as a toner pad or mini face mask.
✅ More competitive price: $10.39 at Stylevana.
🚫 Less effective in controlling oil and refining pores.

After all, I prefer the 💙 Medicube Zero Pore Pad 2.0 for summer when the high humidity and hot weather make my skin feel heavy and oily. It’s a bit pricey but I think it’s worth every penny.

However, Farmstay may suit you better if you have a combination to dry skin and are on a budget.

⚠️ Remarks: Don’t mix AHA, BHA, and PHA with Vitamin C and Retinol. If you use Niacinamide, apply it at different times of the day or at least 30 minutes apart.

They’re $39 each and come in 6 shades.

Description says they’re “A highly pigmented and creamy liquid-to-powder blush that's blendable, buildable, and melts into skin for a blurring, soft-cloud finish and up to 12 hours of wear.”

I fully agree with the description (how refreshing!) They remind me of the Rare Beauty liquid blushes but I find these to be slightly less pigmented, which gives me more control. But a little still goes a very long way, as I learned when I applied these for the first time in this reel. You really only need one dot.

My skin EATS blush so I rarely have high hopes for blush that claims to be long-lasting, but these blew me away. I love the soft matte finish, which helps the product last longer on my skin, and I really hope YSL expands this shade range! This one’s a banger. 

The price tag is steep but it’s worth it for me to splurge on a product that’s easy to apply and doesn’t fade quickly. I’m definitely going to buy the shade 44 Nude Lavalliere!

On one hand, Ilia has made HUGE improvements with their shade range. This has a whopping 42 shades!

I love that this has buildable medium coverage, but it’s quite stiff to blend and the soft matte finish gets VERY oily on my combination skin. I just feel like it don’t make me look very good, but I’m very grateful to Ilia for sending me the product in PR.

I’ve heard from a lot of people that this gets oily, so I wouldn’t purchase it if you’re looking for a true soft matte finish.

What do you think? Have you tried this?

I love DIY hairstyles and literally taught myself how to braid! 💪 So, I decided to try Lemonade Fulani Braids on my 4C natural hair, combining knotless braids in the back with added curly pieces for a stylish touch. Even though I wish my curls were looser, this method still works!

looking for a stylish and easy protective hairstyle? Watch as I create short Lemonade Fulani Braids on my 4C natural hair, featuring knotless braids in the back for a lightweight, versatile look. This style is perfect for low-maintenance beauty while keeping your hair protected!

✨ Hair Prep Tip:
🔥 I boiled the hair before curling to soften it and reduce tangling.
🌙 I also slept with curlers on for tighter curls, and I’m loving the final results!

I swear, these new launches are coming faster and faster lol. But I always love a good cleansing balm, so I had to try out this one.
⚡️
This one fits into the waxy sherbet type of texture. Has fragrance or essential oils and it’s pretty simple in formula. It melts down into an oil very easily, and emulsifies well. Make sure you use enough water to get that thin milky texture, because I feel like it has a bit of thickness or grippiness with not enough water.
⚡️
I do think this is a great cleansing balm for the decent price point. If you try this one for yourself let me know what you think!

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Supergoop today!
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, and Octisalate
- It has a lotion texture, feels lightweight
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural radiant finish
- Has added essential oils
- Does not sting my eyes
- Water and sweat resistant
- Around $24 for 71mL. Can be purchased from their website or Sephora.
🔆
This is one of their bestsellers. I've tried this years ago but I still hear people talk about this one to this day. One of the best feeling American sunscreens I'd say. Goes on easily and doesn't feel heavy in my skin. They also have the SPF 50 version. Can work for all skin types but the finish is definitely  more on the radiant side. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

*Gifted by YesStyle 

Say hello to a subtle glow and natural flush with lilybyred Luv Beam Cheek Balm in #2 Innocent Pink! 🌸 This creamy, buildable blush has stolen my heart (literally, just look at the cute heart-shaped packaging! 💕). Here’s why I love it:

✨ Glow Up: Adds soft, glowy color to cheeks for that perfect flushed look.

🎨 Buildable Formula: Go sheer for a natural vibe or layer up for a bold pop of color—no caking, no stickiness!

🌿 Skin Brightening: The lavender undertone of #2 Innocent Pink blends beautifully with my warm skin tone, brightening dull complexions effortlessly.

👩‍🎨 Easy to Use: Apply with your fingertip or a makeup puff for a seamless blend.

While I wouldn’t use it on my lips (the shade’s a bit light for me), it’s a total win for cheeks! 💕 Perfect for that soft girl aesthetic or a fresh, everyday look.

🔴 Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!


I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

🍒 @kajabeauty The Kaja Jelly Charm Lip & Blush Glazed Keychain Stain (Cherry Spritz) is one of the products from my recent @sephora haul. 🛍️ I was drawn to it by its irresistible packaging and versatile color. I love how lightweight it feels, and it can be built up for a pop of jelly-like color on the lips and cheeks. 👄

💕 The love charm keychain is absolutely adorable, and the shade Cherry Spritz, a red with a blue undertone, helps enhance my skin complexion. I wouldn’t say it’s a long-lasting color, as I need to reapply several times a day, which doesn’t bother me. However, it might not be the best choice for those seeking a long-wearing lip stain.

🥰 When using it as a liquid blush, I prefer to apply it with my fingers, as it’s easier to control the color. For seamless blending, apply it on bare skin or over a product with a liquid or creamy texture. It’s weightless, making blending a breeze. 🍃

Thanks to @axisy_official AXIS-Y for sending these goodies my way for an honest review. They arrived just in time as I was looking for brightening products to tackle my dull skin and excess sebum on my T-zone. Let’s dive in! 🌿💧

🌟 What is AXIS-Y Spot The Difference Blemish Treatment?
Formulated with 4-Terpineol, the active ingredient of tea tree leaf oil, it soothes and calms irritated skin. It also contains Heartleaf, Licorice Root Extract, and Pink Calamine Beads to control excess sebum and prevent breakouts. 🌿 The gentle formula is designed to be non-drying, making it perfect for sensitive, breakout-prone skin.

My Experience:
I use it around my nose to help control sebum, and I immediately feel a cooling sensation! 💙 It’s non-drying, and I love seeing the Pink Calamine Beads melt into my skin as I massage it in. 👃✨

💫 What is AXIS-Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum?
Packed with Niacinamide (5%), a powerful ingredient that reduces hyperpigmentation and brightens dark spots. 💧 It also features Papaya Extract and Sea Buckthorn for skin regeneration, leaving your skin glowing and smooth. It’s perfect for fading dark spots and post-acne marks while giving the skin a bright and even complexion.

My Experience:
One of my faves — I’m on my second tube! 😍 It’s a holy grail for dull skin and post-acne marks, giving me a healthy, glowing finish without irritation or dryness. 🌟

☀️ What is AXIS-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen V.3?
It contains Zinc Oxide, Niacinamide (2%) and Squalane, which hydrate the skin while soothing irritation.

My Experience:
💦 Its essence-gel-lotion texture layers perfectly over the Glow Serum, leaving just a subtle white sheen that actually brightens up my complexion. 💡🌞 I appreciate that it’s a physical sunscreen and doesn’t feel too thick or chalky on my skin. I would say it’s more suitable for dry skin, or oily and combination skin in dry weather. 🍁

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Prequel today!
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octocrylene, and Octisalate
- It has a milky fluid texture, feels lightweight
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a radiant finish
- No added fragrance
- This stings my eyes
- Around $25 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website.
🔆
Always excited to see a launch from one of my favorite brands. Their first sunscreen launch was a mineral sunscreen so obviously that one did not work for me. This one is better for dry skin. Main drawback for me though is that this did sting my eyes everyday I used it, so unfortunately this is not the one for me. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Cetaphil today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a cream texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No greyness in my facial hair
- Has a natural radiant finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Stings my eyes
- Around 12-14 pumps to get the necessary amount for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- Around $15 for 88mL. Can be purchased from retailers like Target or CVS.
🔆
I was hoping this would be a good option in comparison to the Cerave AM moisturizer in similar packaging. But the eye sting ruined it for me unfortunately. I was expecting it to be really lightweight because it saws oil free and plains to have a satin matte finish. But this was actually pretty moisturizing and creamy. The finish is definitely more radiant than I was expecting. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

I’ll begin by saying I’ve struggled with my scalp being very dry for a while and although my hair was growing it was also extremely dry, so I decided to shave my head and loved it, but the goal was to find products and a hair care routine that would give me a healthy scalp! 

I wasn’t even planing to grow my hair out and now I am after I stopped shaving 2 months ago. This is not a sponsored post nor were this products gifted, I spent my little coiiinnss @beyondbotanix okayyy. I just hope this helps the girlies who need it!

I like to start with the Fermented Herbal Onion Rice Water Treatment. I shake it well and then apply it to my scalp and hair. I massage and leave it on for 45 mins with a plastic cap, then I rinse out completely and keep it refrigerated! 

Then I follow up with the Cinnamon & Fenugreek Natural Scalp Scrub. I like to apply a good amount of scrub to my fingertips and then I begin massaging my entire scalp gently. I let it sit for about 10-15mins and rise out well.

Next I use the Aloe Vera and Clove Shampoo & Chebe and Neem Conditioner once a week routinely with the rest of my scalp/hair care routine.

Right after, I love spraying the Potent Herbal Scalp Tonic by applying it directly to the scalp and massaging. This is a leave in product!

Followed by the Moringa, Nettle & Ambunu Leave-In Conditioner which I use once a week. This one is best used on dry or damp hair, all you need to do is part your hair into sections and apply it to the scalp & hair.

Add a little extra moisturiser with the Herbal Citrus Rice Pudding Hair Spray. Shake it well, mist your scalp and hair every other day or as needed and don’t rinse out. 

I seal everything with the Herbal Hair Growth Oil. I like to use it everyday by applying to the scalp and massaging, but you can also use it as a hot oil treatment!

This is the scalp care or hair care routine that’s worked for me, but you can always feel free to leave out products you might not necessarily need depending on your hair type and scalp care needs.

Again, I just hope this helps the girlies that need it.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Kiehl’s today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a fluid lotion texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- Works well in my facial hair
- Has a natural radiant finish
- Does not sting me eyes
- Around 10-12 pumps to get the necessary amount for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- No added fragrance or essential oils
- Around $42 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or credo beauty.
🔆
Love not having to spend like 2 minutes rubbing my face. No white cast or issues in my facial hair. Maybe those with super oily skin would not enjoy this, because it has me looking quite shiny at the end of the day from its moisture. But I think it can work for a variety of people. I don’t go to sunscreens for the added ingredients, but this does also have added peptides that are supposed to help with stimulating collagen production. Solid new launch! Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

It’s a gorgeous sheer but buildable pinky coral with some sheen to it.

The formula is a hard-pressed powder so it’s really easy to control.

I’m using it with an @itcosmetics for @ultabeauty 113 brush, which is my favorite blush brush of all time.

Have you tried the Lawless blushes? If so, what’s your favorite? I think my #1 is Vintage Love and Sakura is #2!

Cristiano Ronaldo, born on February 5, 1985, in Madeira, Portugal, is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. From a young age, Ronaldo showcased his prodigious talent, which saw him joining Sporting CP before making a high-profile move to Manchester United in 2003. His time at Manchester United was marked by rapid development, where his dribbling, pace, and ability to score goals from any position made him a fan favorite. Ronaldo's impact at Old Trafford was profound, helping the club secure three Premier League titles, a UEFA Champions League, and a host of other honors. His 2008 Ballon d'Or win was the first of many accolades that would define his illustrious career.

#CristianoRonaldo #CR7 #ManchesterUnited #PremierLeague #FootballLegend #GOAT #BallondOr #Madeira #SportingCP #RedDevils #ChampionsLeague #SoccerStar #RonaldoMagic #FootballIcon

In 2009, Ronaldo made a world-record transfer to Real Madrid, where he would cement his legacy as one of the sport's greatest. His time at the Santiago Bernabéu was nothing short of legendary. Ronaldo scored an astonishing 450 goals in 438 appearances, becoming the club’s all-time leading scorer. His goal-scoring feats included an incredible consistency in the UEFA Champions League, where he led Real Madrid to four titles in five years. Ronaldo's rivalry with Lionel Messi during this period became one of the most talked-about aspects of football, with fans and pundits alike debating who was the better player.

In 2018, Ronaldo sought a new challenge and transferred to Juventus in Serie A, where he continued to defy expectations. In Italy, Ronaldo maintained his extraordinary standards, leading Juventus to consecutive Serie A titles and further cementing his reputation as a goal-scoring machine. Despite being in his mid-30s, his physical prowess, dedication to training, and relentless pursuit of excellence ensured that he remained at the top of his game. Ronaldo's impact in Italy proved that his abilities transcended leagues and that he was capable of dominating in any environment.

Ronaldo's influence extends beyond the pitch as he has become a global icon and a brand in his own right. With millions of followers on social media, Ronaldo is one of the most marketable athletes in the world, endorsing major brands and launching his own CR7 product line. His work off the field, including charitable efforts and philanthropy, has further endeared him to fans around the globe. Ronaldo's ability to inspire young footballers and his contribution to the sport is immeasurable, solidifying his status as not just a footballer but a global phenomenon.

As of 2024, Ronaldo continues to play at the highest level, demonstrating an extraordinary longevity that few athletes can match. Whether it’s breaking records, scoring crucial goals, or simply inspiring the next generation of footballers, Ronaldo’s impact on the game remains unmatched. His journey from the streets of Madeira to becoming a global superstar is a testament to his hard work, talent, and unyielding determination. Ronaldo's legacy in football is secure, and his name will be remembered for generations as one of the sport's true greats.

Hair loss is a deeply personal problem, affecting how you see yourself and how you face the world. For our patient, the struggle was all too real. As a woman experiencing significant hair thinning, she felt like she was losing more than just hair; she was losing confidence and her femininity. After trying countless products and seeing little to no change, she came to Ashley desperate for a solution that would finally work.

Ashley, our NYC-based nurse injector, worked closely with her to turn her hair loss into hair growth through advanced PRP therapy.  By injecting the platelet-rich plasma directly into the scalp, we delivered powerful growth factors that stimulate dormant hair follicles, essentially “jump-starting” their natural growth cycle. The addition of exosomes and stem cells supercharged the process, encouraging healthier, thicker, and stronger hair growth over time.

This patient’s transformation has been nothing short of remarkable. By targeting the root causes of hair loss and using cutting-edge regenerative techniques, Ashley helped her reclaim the confidence she thought was gone for good. It’s about more than just seeing hair grow back—it’s about seeing yourself in the mirror and feeling whole again. 

This is only after about a month! As more time passes, her hair will only continue to grow and thicken, so stay tuned for updates!

If you're grappling with hair loss and are tired of solutions that don't work, come see Ashley or myself to turn back the clock on your hair!

Description: A creamy, high-pigment, non-drying matte liner for lips, eyes, and cheeks to create infinite looks.

The Tower 28 OneLiners are one of my favorite lip liners of all time. The OG shade work of art is a tiny little stub in my makeup drawer and I already have a backup, so needless to say, I was STOKED when they launched three new shades.

These are just $15 and I’m always pleasantly surprised by Tower 28’s price point.

The formula has a great creaminess to it that allows the pencil to glide on like a dream, but there’s still grip to it so it doesn’t slide around or fade quickly. That said, if you want a budge-proof liner that sets down, this is not for you.

I can’t get enough of these and I love the new shades, I can’t even pick a favorite anymore. Work of Art, Check Me Out, and Paint My Number are all staples in my regular routine.

You can buy the Tower 28 OneLiners at Sephora: https://rstyle.me/+-xI-uIZODxhDH_OP55yGuQ

Step 1: Comb your brows into place with a spoolie 

Step 2: Use a tinted & volumizing brow gel to add color and also thickness to the brow. My favorite right now is @urbandecaycosmetics 😍

Step 3: Fill in sparse areas with a brow pen or pencil ✏️ I love the brow pen by @benefitcosmetics because it creates the natural look of individual brow hairs! I use shade 4 

Step 4: Set the brows into place with a clear brow gel so they stay in place all day!

💄✨ I’ve always wanted to try a matte lip pencil, so I couldn’t resist picking up these goodies from rom&nd! 😍 I bought #03 Kaya Beige and #04 Fig Breeze, and they do not disappoint! The formula is super creamy and pigmented, making it easy to glide on. The round, thick tips make drawing a lip liner a breeze, and the best part? It’s versatile! You can use it as a matte lipstick or as a base color and layer with a lip tint for that perfect blurry lip look. 😘💋

At less than $9 each from YesStyle, it’s totally worth it! 💸 The only tiny complaint? #03 Kaya Beige is a bit more nude than expected compared to the website, but I make it work by layering a darker beige lipstick for a cozy Autumn vibe. 🍂✨

🔎 Product Info:
- A 2-in-1 matte lip pencil with a built-in finger brush for a defined lip shape 💯
- 6 natural muted shades for a daily blurred lip look
- Smudge-free, long-lasting formula without a cakey or dry feel 💋

As someone in her thirties who has lived in Southern California, our patient had a lot of sun damage that she wanted treated to get her skin looking bright and even. She came to us for the Halo Laser, which is not only phenomenal for getting rid of sun damage, but is also great for improving skin texture--which is why we use it so often to treat acne scars in our treatment combinations.   
     Our patient today didn't have any of those, so we focused on evening out her skin tone and removing that sun damage. We also put her on a dedicated skin care routine following her treatment so that she was able to heal quickly and properly. Her skin looks better than it ever has before and she's absolutely glowing both inside and out.

Carmel is a beautiful muted rose
Georgia is a gorgeous sun kissed peach

I usually don’t like cream blush for a variety of reasons: they never last well, they lift foundation, they’re sticky and hard to blend, and they’re often too dewy on my combination skin.

But I absolutely adore the Persona Dreamstick formula! The shade Bloom has been my favorite and now I think Carmel might be tied for #1! 

These are $26 and are an extremely bendable formula with a slight dewy finish, but it never feels sticky or greasy.  My face eats cream blush so it’s not the most long-lasting blush on me, but it performs better than 99% of cream blushes I’ve tried.

I’m so excited that Persona continues to expand their shade range of the Dreamstick!

Which shade do you like best?

Step 1: Use a lip liner to slightly over line your lips, I’m using medium pink rose from ‪@SmashboxCosmetics‬ 

Step 2: Apply a blush oil that reacts to your skin’s pH to give you the perfect shade, unique to you. I am the using BYO blush from ‪@youthforia‬ 

Step 3: Blend & clean up edges 

Step 4: Dab a little red lipstick (personally prefer a liquid lipstick) like this one “Bawse” from ‪@SmashboxCosmetics‬ and focus the color towards the center of your lips. 

Step 5: Let it dry & then use a tissue to bloat the excess lipstick off. Clean of edges if you need to. 

Step 6: Apply a gloss or lip oil of choice. I am using “Prestige” from Jule Lipgloss 

Step 7: Slay!!! And share this with someone who might need this quick beauty hack!!!

She’d been following my results on social media, amazed by the transformations she’d seen! For her, it wasn’t just about improving her skin- it was about reclaiming her confidence too.

Here’s the combination approach I used to target her deep ice pick and atrophic scars:

✅ Subcision - We began with subcision to break up the scar tissue bound to deeper layers of skin, creating new collagen formation and lifting indented areas

✅ Pixel - to gently resurface the outermost skin layers, improving overall texture and reducing the appearance of superficial scars. This step helped refine her skin for a smoother, more even finish.

✅ CO2 Laser - Finally, we used CO2 laser for deep remodeling. This powerful laser stimulates collagen production at a deeper level to support and lift the skin from within, especially beneficial for her more severe ice pick scars.

She's looking amazing just one month after her treatment! For best results, she'll be back for more maintenance and improvement. Every treatment plan is uniquely crafted to address your specific concerns and skin type, ensuring you get the most effective results with minimal downtime. With over 15 years of experience, I know how to create the perfect blend of treatments to help you achieve your skin goals.

Whether you’re looking to smooth out texture, diminish scars, or brighten your overall complexion, I’ll work with you to design a laser plan that truly fits your needs.

Our patient is a television host who will be on camera in a week. In order to get his skin looking pristine and to achieve that youthful glow, he came to us for a dynamic duo combination treatment. This beloved treatment consist of Sylfirm and Moxi. @sylfirmx.usa uses micro needling radio frequency to work wonders by getting a balanced complexion, minimizing pores as well as fine lines and wrinkles, and treating skin laxity. We commonly use Sylfirm on the face and neck, however, it can truly be used ALL OVER the body to improve laxity anywhere. After Sylfirm, comes the “bright” aspect- Moxi. We love this laser as it combats signs of aging, improves and balances the skin’s tone and texture, plus when combined with Sylfirm it will achieve enhanced results leaving reduced skin laxity. Right after his treatment we began his after care- using the EMER SKIN Hydration Mask to soothe and calm his skin post micro needling and laser. To maximize his results, he used the EMER SKIN Dermergency Kit in the days following his treatment. Not only does the Dermergency Kit help with sun damage, but it minimizes pores and uneven skin tones. His skin is looking more youthful and radiant than ever- plus his complexion is now balanced. 

BENEFITS OF MOXI 
✅ Downtime is customized
✅ Safe for every skin type 
✅ Can be combined with MNRF to combat skin laxity
✅ Can be combined with BBL HERO for redness
✅ Add PRP to enhance improvement and speed healing
✅ Treatment greatly reduces the risk for skin cancer and 
✅ Treatment is effective in treating signs of skin aging such as rosacea, uneven pigmentation, tone, texture and fine lines

The DERMERGENCY KIT is designed to be used as a skin ""booster"" to help improve outbreaks, get you ready for an event, or just maintain your skin with a once or twice a month at-home treatment. Want to see how quickly his complexion improved?

💕 YesStyle Reward Code: BEAUTYKAT321 💕

Happy Easter everyone! 🐣🥙🧆 Today I am going to talk about a face cleanser - Kanebo Suisai Beauty Clear Powder Wash 🧼 This face cleansing powder has been in the market for almost 2 decades and it was a pioneer in the beauty industry back then. 🛩️🌎

There have been a lot of options/copycats since then but I always stick to this cleanser for its effectiveness without stripping natural skin moisture.

1️⃣ Features of this No.1 face cleansing powder:

✅ Amino acid-based
✅ Fragrance-free & colorless
✅ Infused with 2 kinds of enzymes to unclog pores, prevent acnes, minimize dead skin and blackheads.
✅ Easy to carry and can be used daily

1️⃣ Kanebo Suisai has 4 types of Beauty Clear Powder in YesStyle.

🌟 The regular one which I showcase in the reel is an original formula for all skin types.
🌟 Gold Powder Wash contains Squalane and other hydrating ingredients for dry and mature skin.
🌟 Sakura & Peach formula is limited edition.
🌟 Black Powder Wash contains Charcoal and Moroccan Lava for oily skin.

My patient came to me after experiencing a massive breakout caused by medication... The acne left behind deep, stubborn scars that were not only damaging to her skin but also her self-esteem. She was relying on heavy makeup every day just to feel comfortable! 😬

We created a custom ACNE SCAR COMBINATION TREATMENT to dramatically improve her skin texture and give her back the confidence to go makeup-free:

✅ Pixel8 RF 
✅ CO2 Laser for deep resurfacing and scar smoothing

Microneedling with radiofrequency adds deep channeling into the skin—tightening, smoothing scars, and stimulating new collagen production. It’s a game-changer for ALL skin types, especially for darker skin tones where lasers alone can cause pigmentation issues. Plus, it enhances the penetration of topical treatments to maximize results.

This is just the beginning—our plan includes more treatments to take her results to the next level. She’s already feeling confident in her skin and no longer has to hide behind layers of makeup! How amazing does she look? 😊

📲 If acne scars are holding you back, it’s time for a change. DM me your full name, email, and phone number to schedule a consultation, and let’s get started on your transformation.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Rovectin today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T 150, Parsol SLX, Tinosorb M
- It has a light cream texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- Shows greyness in my facial hair
- Has a natural finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $22 for 50mL. Can be purchased from retailers like Stylevana or YesStyle. Code SHOPGSG for discount on Stylevana.
🔆
This is a new launch from the brand and I was excited to check it out because I feel like I haven't tried a new Korean sunscreen in a minute! Has that same standard great texture and application experience you can expect from a lot of Korean sunscreens. Although I didn't have any white cast, you might see something if you are darker than me and I wouldn't recommend it for those that have dark coarse facial hair like I do because of the Tinosorb M. But for everyone else, it's pretty nice. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

~PR~
As someone with oily skin, gel creams are always gonna have a special place in my heart lol. They really are the go-to. This new one from @itcosmetics is the perfect texture I love. It is a beautifully lightweight gel cream that is easy to apply.
⚡️
I've only been using it for a couple weeks, but it is deeply hydrating for my skin, which I appreciate. It has a good ingredient mix of Niacinamide, Peptides, and Zinc PCA. 
⚡️
It does minimize shine when it is applied, but I don't notice any real oil control throughout the day from it, so idk about that claim. The price is also higher than I would like for a moisturizer. But I do like it enough to continue use, so I'll update how I feel in a couple weeks.

They’re $22 each and the website says they’re a “creamy liquid blush that easily blends and builds for naturally flushed, flirty cheeks that last all day.”

If you’re new here, my face says cream blush, so I figured these would work for me and I was right. They feel extremely oily and when I wore them on top of a matte foundation, they broke up my base and made a total mess.

When I tried them on top of a glowy foundation (like in this video) they didn’t break up my foundation, but they did look a little patchy, and they faded extremely fast.

I have combination skin so I personally don’t love a dewy cheek, but if you have dry skin or love a wet-finish, I could see you enjoying these.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Coppertone today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a clear gel texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- Works fine in my facial hair
- Has a radiant finish
- Has added fragrance but I don't find it strong
- Does not sting my eyes
- Water and sweat resistant
- Around $10 for 59mL. Can be purchased from their retailers like Target.
🔆
I believe this is new since I just saw it popping up in my stores. I just don't love the feel of this on my skin, so I still prefer other options for the clear gel sunscreens. It just kinda sits on top of my skin. This is pretty affordable, so decent enough to check out. I would just pass if you have oily skin. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

At first, I didn’t like the way it looked because it’s so thin and blendable that the coverage blended away too quickly and it settled/creased easily. Plus, shade 5 is also too warm for me.

But after I set the concealer with powder and did the rest of my makeup, I noticed that it started to become more “one with my skin.” The formula worked really well with powder to prevent it from sliding around too much, and I like that it has a satin natural finish, it’s not too dewy but not too matte. That’s why a wear test is important, the formula grew on me as I wore it.

I’d say if you like medium coverage and you want a concealer that is super blendable and thin, that you can use all over the face or as under-eye concealer - this is for you.

If you’re like me and you prefer a more full coverage concealer with a tackier/thicker formula, or you have cool pink undertones, then I’d pass.

Note: I swatched all of the fair and light shades at Sephora and every shade looked yellow :/ unfortunately this is a pretty standard experience for me with clean beauty brands.

In this reel I said it was $8 but it’s currently on @yesstyle for around $12.60 and yesterday it was $10.40. I’ve seen the price fluctuate from $8-$14 so it just depends when you buy it.

The formula is creamier than MUFE and it has a blurring quality that I love.

I think a lot of you with light skin will like it, and the rest of the 3 shades are natural lip tones. My only complaint is that there are only 4 colors, this formula is SO good we need more!!

Thanks to @axisy_official for sending me the Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum and Vegan Collagen Eye Serum for reviews. Here’s a quick unboxing video and my first impression of the Glow Serum:

🌿 AXIS-Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum contains 5% Niacinamide that improves dark spots and uneven skin tone. With the help of plant-derived Squalane, this serum retains moisture to keep the skin glowing and healthy.

My first impression:

💚 It’s a lightweight brightening serum in gel texture that is suitable for all skin types.
💚 No artificial fragrance to minimize skin irritation.
💚 Easy to glide on the skin.
💚 Absorbs quickly.
💚 Non greasy layer.

I will use it with my soothing toner and Axis-Y Vegan Collagen Eye Cream for at least a week. Stay tuned for a detailed review. 😊

She has a very difficult skin type to treat, as her skin tone is both darker and sensitive. This is one of the reasons she came to us. We have a breadth of experience treating patients with darker skin types. Before we even began, we set expectations and goals with her. She will require more than one round of treatments to get her skin where she wants it, but the first step is always the biggest. What a positive one it was, too. She loved the amount of improvement we achieved with this round of treatments and she cannot wait to do more in the near future.

THE LINEUP 
✅ BELLAFILL
✅ HYBRID LASER
✅ PRP

No treatment is complete without EMER SKIN, especially acne scar treatments. Emer Skin is phenomenal for helping patients heal properly and expediently. Using our products post-treatment will also enhance results to the absolute maximum.

Trying out the new Beauty of Joseon mask and I really enjoyed it on my first impressions! It does a little bit of everything. The star is the rice lees extract from upcycled makgeolli or Korean rice wine. The soothing and moisture aspects are what stick out to me so far, but this really seems like a great all-in-one type of mask.

I never thought I’d try a makeup spatula, but after watching tons of makeup videos on YouTube, I decided to give it a shot. I paired the spatula with the Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation to see if this combination works well on my textured skin. The foundation is on the heavier side (medium to full coverage), so I believed the spatula would help thin it out, which is perfect for my combination skin and the humid weather in Hong Kong 💦🇭🇰.

My guess was right! The foundation looks more natural and is less likely to get patchy since there’s less product on my face to begin with. 🌟

How to use it:

🖐️ Place the foundation on the back of your hand or use a steel makeup palette like I do.
🎨 Glide the spatula with the foundation on your face, starting from the inside out.
💦 Wet the attached sponge to blend the foundation.

I had a lot of fun using it, but I don’t think I’ll use it daily as it takes more time to finish my makeup. Still, the tool looks great on my dressing table, and I’m happy I got it!

Using a combination of Bellafill and Radiesse filler, we're going to enhance his already sculpted anatomy so that he looks contoured and natural. We are going to add structure to his jawline and give him a sharper, stronger look on his cheek bones. He got exactly what he was looking for and the results speak for themselves.

🎨 PICASSO LIKE INJECTIONS
We meticulously place filler to his cheeks and add a natural-looking structure to his jawline 

↔️ We then move in a horizontal fashion across his cheek area. Going down to the bone gives the filler more support, lifting the cheeks for a slimmer, shapen look to his face

I’ve got green veins around my eye area, so I reach for the dark beige shade in the tfit Cover Up Pro Concealer Palette (01 Neutral) to neutralize that grey-greenish discoloration. For my laugh lines, a touch of natural beige brightens up the shadow, giving my complexion a more even look. ✨

I’m obsessed with the tfit Cover Up Pro Concealer Palette — it offers fantastic coverage and a creamy texture that doesn’t dry out my skin. The shades are perfect not just for concealing but also for highlighting and contouring. Multi-purpose magic! 🔥

Have you tried the tfit Cover Up Pro Concealer Palette? 🥰

✅ This moisturizer combines Aloe Vera Extract for hydrating, soothing, protecting, and retaining water in the skin. It also contains Organic Grape Water which moisturises and soothes the skin without leaving a greasy layer.

According to the product website, this product is designed for normal to combination skin and it doesn’t have Parabens, Sulfates, Silicone, or other harmful ingredients.

On top of that, it is blended with
✅ 98% Natural Origin Ingredients
✅ Dermatologically Tested
✅ Non-Comedogenic and
✅ Vegan

Sounds great, right? But….

🤔 My POV: I have normal to dry skin and I do need an extra boost in Winter so this product is a bit too light for my skin type. I have been using this moisturizer in the morning for 2 weeks but my skin feels a bit tight so I need to mix it with another facial oil or use a serum before this moisturizer for extra skin nourishment. This is fine with me as I know my skin needs different products during the year; for example, AHA/BHA in Summer but facial oil or snail mucin essence in Winter, but what bothers me is the FRAGRANCE contained in the moisturizer.

😔 I don’t have sensitive skin so I don’t mind using a product with fragrance but this one is just too strong, too overwhelming, and too artificial!

Some reviews on their website say that this cream peels off and it doesn’t mix well with their makeup or sunscreen. I do not have this problem though as I use it with facial oil and blend it on the palm to warm up the product first, then massage it on the skin so the finish is soft and smooth. If you have a peeling problem when you use this product, you may use this way to prepare it before using it.

I really want to love this moisturizer but I don’t. 🙁 It’s a pity as I know the texture will be perfect for my skin type in Summer. Their “Clean for Skin” concept, “Non-irritating” and “Clean for Planet” formulas are what I appreciate but I just can’t deal with the heavy fragrance.

Is it only my thing? Will you use a skin care product with fragrance?

Our patient today is a model, so naturally she wants to look her best on and off camera. She's noticed her skin has been dry, so to fix this she came in for one of our newest treatments: Skinvive. 

SKIN GLOW
Skinvive is very diverse- it can be used as a micro needling treatment, done in between laser treatments, as a combo treatment with a facial, or to hydrate the skin making it glow more than ever.

SMALL BUT MIGHTY
Consisting of hyaluronic acid, Skinvive has a gel-like texture and targets the skin superficially. Check out the little blebs- that's how we know her skin is getting that extra hydration.

INTERNAL CHAPSTICK
We meticulously treat all areas of her face, this will not only ensure her skin is completely hydrated- but also reduce any fine lines or wrinkles she has.

JAWLINE TIME
Moving onto the jawline, we do multiple passes along and under her jawline to tighten the skin in this area. One of the many reasons patients love this treatment is due to the minimal downtime, a couple days of healing for 6 months of glowing, hydrated skin- that's a no brainer.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST
We went the extra mile by treating her hairline, she did another treatment with us using an organic filler so this will maximize her results from both treatments. We love combination treatments and Skinvive is a perfect example of this.

IMMEDIATELY AFTER
She found the procedure to be slightly painful but overall not that bad and definitely worth it in the end.

DAY 2
She is a little swollen and has a small bruise but so far she is loving her results.

Our patient has a bit of a baby face, which is great—he looks young—but he wanted to look more masculine, so he came to us to sculpt out his chin and jawline. He did a lot of research and decided we were the best and most experienced around for male facial sculpting. What we do is artistry and it is very important that he was made to look more masculine by building out the chin and sharpening the jawline, while keeping him looking perfectly natural. He was thrilled with how his results looked once the filler settled and plans to come to only us for all his future filler needs.

My skin always responds well to regular double cleansing in my PM routine. Maybe because I have oily skin and tend to be prone to blackheads without it. What's your current to-go cleanser?

I'm using this combo from Elemis tonight. The cleansing balm is a nice texture that is pretty popular. The scent is up to personal preference but they have other options. I particularly loved their Green Fig scent. The Dynamic Resurfacing Cleanser is a gel cleanser with a nice creamy foam lather. It has added enzymes for the resurfacing benefits.

*Gift from YesStyle Influencer Program

This blusher delivers a natural rosy glow for luminous, glowing cheeks all day long. 💫 With 80% skincare ingredients, including Adenosine and Centella Asiatica, it nourishes your skin while adding a beautiful flush of color. 🌿💧

👩‍🔬 What I love:

- Lightweight texture, perfect for all skin types! 💕
- Long-lasting, subtle shimmer for that natural, dewy finish. ✨
- Easily buildable color that’s not too intense or too faint! 👍
- No cakey finish, and it lasts up to 8 hours without drying out my skin! 😍

I apply this on top of my combo-to-dry skin (with a moisturizer and liquid foundation but no makeup primer!), and it still stays beautifully. Wish MIGUHARA would launch more shades in the future! 💖

If you're looking for that snatched, refreshed, sculpted look... let me tell you—this is where my artistry shines! Creating natural, balanced results is all about understanding the face’s structure and knowing how to enhance every angle. I’ve spent over 15 years perfecting this, so when you’re ready to level up, I’m your guy. 💯

Here’s the game plan:

Step 1: Filler 💉
I’m bringing in the heavy hitters—Radiesse and Restylane—to sculpt, smooth, and define:
✅ Temples – Filling hollows to frame the face
✅ Chin + Jawline – Sculpting sharp angles for that killer contour
✅ Nose – Refining without surgery
✅ Lips – Subtle volume for a refreshed pout
✅ Midface + Cheeks – Lifting and restoring balance

Step 2: Threads 🪡
Threads are a total game changer! We’re lifting and tightening midface folds, smoothing laxity, and locking in that rejuvenated, lifted vibe—no surgery, no downtime.

And of course, no visit is complete without stocking up on @emer.skin because keeping your skin glowing at home is just as important!

Results like this don’t just happen. They’re built on years of experience, precision, and an eye for detail that can’t be faked. Don’t trust your face to just anyone—you deserve the best and that's what I'm here for!

After almost 2 weeks of travel, I feel like my skin needs an extra boost of hydration to soothe fine lines and soften my rough skin texture 😅 I’m from Rice Cream came at a perfect time when my skin needed the most attention 😘

I love using I’m from Rice Cream after the Rice Toner and the Rice Serum. The face cream offers intensive moisturization and rehydration to my skin. I love the glowy result and it seems that my fine lines have improved. 🥹 However, when the weather is getting warmer, I think the cream becomes a little bit too rich for me so I have switched my routine - from using it twice a day to once in the evening. 💕 I love how spreadable the cream is so I use it on my neck and collarbone as a massage cream too.

🌾 So what is I’m from Rice Cream?
1️⃣ It is a moisturizing cream infused with 41% Rice Bran Essence for skin barrier improvement and skin moisturization.
2️⃣ Blends with natural fatty acids which help to improve the skin barrier to protect the skin from environmental damage.
3️⃣ Fragrance-free and Artificial Coloring Free

Another interesting fact about this cream is how the company extracts the Rice Bran Essence. They claim that a Vacuum Distillation Extraction Method is used, in which the water is boiled at a low temperature with the Rice Bran and after 60 mins, the Rice Bran Essence is extracted and collected so it is not a synthetic skincare ingredient.

😄 My thoughts on this cream:
❤️ Great moisturization! If you have dry skin, this cream is for you!
❤️ Improves fine lines & dull skin complexion.
❤️ Smooths my rough skin texture.
❤️ Use it as a night or a massage cream if you have normal or normal to dry skin. Your skin will thank you for the softness and bounciness.
🤨 However, I do not recommend it for oily skin, and if you have sensitive eyes, avoid using it on eye areas.

Acne scars had completely robbed him of their confidence, and nothing he tried had worked. But that’s why he came to me! I’m not here to just “fix” your scars. I’m here to transform your skin and your life. And that’s exactly what I did! 🤩

I didn’t give him some cookie-cutter treatment. I created a powerful combination treatment plan to obliterate those scars from every angle. We started with Bellafill—because I don’t do temporary fixes! I do long-term solutions for deep scars. Then, I hit the reset button with Pixel8 MNRF, pushing collagen production deep below the surface to smooth out the skin. To refine and resurface, I pulled out the big guns: CO2 laser—we’re talking skin-revolutionizing power that gets results.

But here’s where most providers would stop… Not me! I wrapped up the treatment with the best in the game, AnteAge Exosomes with PRP to make sure the healing process was on overdrive. Why wait for results when we can speed them up? Then, to finish it all off and leave this patient feeling like they just got a luxury spa experience and a total skin overhaul, I gave them my signature Glacial Facial with the Emer Skin Hydration Mask. The result? Cooling, soothing, and instant recovery.

Here’s the deal: I don’t just treat acne scars. I completely change the game. I push boundaries, I use advanced technology that other doctors won’t touch, and I give my patients the results they deserve. This patient’s skin is smoother than ever, those scars are fading fast, and his confidence boost is through the roof you guys!

Today's plan:

💉 Bellafill – Long-lasting, deep scar correction that makes a real difference.
⚡ Pixel8 MNRF – Collagen-boosting, skin-tightening, scar-healing machine.
💥 CO2 Laser – The ultimate resurfacing tool to smooth out any skin imperfections.
💎 AnteAge Exosomes + PRP – Accelerate healing, reduce redness, and amplify results.
🌟 Glacial Facial + Emer Skin Hydration Mask – The perfect post-treatment recovery with cooling, soothing magic @emer.skin 

If you’re tired of waiting for results that never come and you want real change—it’s time to see me!

Advalight is remarkably versatile, capable of treating various skin conditions including brown spots, active acne, acne scars, melasma, rosacea, fine lines, and wrinkles.

First up is 100R Stand Out In Nude—a lovely pinky nude that’s perfect for cool tones. 💖 Next, we have 77A Nude in Roma, a rich caramel brown that looks incredible! 🍂 Then there’s 134R Couture In The Streets—a rosy beige nude, perfect for everyday wear. 🌸 Finally, 508R It’s Valentino Baby, a bold deep berry that’s great for an evening look! 🌙

These lipsticks have a smooth, creamy matte texture with a non-drying formula, making every stroke feel like a breeze! 😍 And can we talk about the packaging? The sensorial studded design with a satisfying magnetic closure adds that extra touch of luxury. ✨

Don’t miss out on these must-haves at @Sephora!

Meet the celimax Dual Barrier Collection, designed to hydrate, protect, and soothe dry & sensitive skin! 💦💖

💙 Dual Barrier Creamy Toner – My #1 fave! 🥇 A lightweight, milky toner that absorbs beautifully without greasiness. Infused with ceramides & peptides, it deeply hydrates while strengthening the skin barrier. No artificial fragrance & pairs well with AHA/BHA or PDRN toners! ✨

💛 Dual Barrier Skin Wearable Cream – My go-to daytime moisturizer! 🌿 It’s lighter than my beloved Mary&May Idebenone Blackberry Intense Cream, making it perfect for spring weather in Hong Kong. Packed with 5 types of ceramides & Aquatide, this cream replenishes and protects for a dewy, plump look. Great for dry and combo-to-dry skin in spring. 

☀️ Dual Barrier Watery Sun Cream – A hydrating mineral sunscreen (SPF 50+ PA++++) that blends smoothly with no rubbery residue under makeup! 🕶️ It has a slight white cast that fades over time — something to note for deeper skin tones.

💚 Oil Control Capsule Essence – A refreshing, jelly-textured essence with Anti Sebum P to control oil & minimize pores for oily skin. It is perfect for summer when my T-zone needs extra care. 🌿 Love the tiny capsules that melt into the essence upon application! However, it takes time to see the visible results of refining pores.

✨Smooth Out Fine Lines in 7 Days – Shiseido Future Solution LX Eye and Lip Contour Regenerating Cream✨

My Experience:
I’ve tried countless eye creams, but Shiseido’s strikes the perfect balance. Its rich, velvety texture absorbs beautifully and layers seamlessly under makeup! 💫

After just a week, my fine lines, sagging eyelids, and puffiness were noticeably reduced. I also love my daily eye and lip massage, which definitely helps me reset for the day. 🌸💆‍♀️

Did I mention the subtle glow of the cream? It instantly blurs imperfections, making this cream a new staple in my routine! 💧💕

Tips:
I was wearing makeup in my Before and After shots. The only difference was the foundation I used, but I also applied loose powder on my delicate eye areas in both shots. While loose powder may cause dryness and cakiness, you can still see that my fine lines have improved significantly. For deep wrinkles and dark circles, it takes longer to see results, so I suggest using this eye cream day and night with a massage routine for better absorption and anti-wrinkle effects. 💆‍♀️✨

What is Shiseido Future Solution LX Eye and Lip Contour Regenerating Cream?

The Shiseido Future Solution LX Eye and Lip Contour Regenerating Cream is inspired by 40 years of genetic research. 🧬 It is specially formulated to improve the delicate areas around the eyes and lips 👁️👄. Its rich and creamy texture melts into the skin, leaving it deeply moisturized, firm, and radiant without any oily residue. 🌟💧

Key Ingredients:
💖 LonGenevity Complex with Enmei Herb, Vitamin C, Green Tea, and Skingenecell 1P – for plump and smooth skin
🌸 Sakura Leaf and Peach Leaf Extract – to protect elastin and strengthen the skin’s structure
🌿 Licorice, Watercress, and Okra Extract – helps diminish the appearance of wrinkles

If fine lines around your eye and lip areas bother you, Shiseido Future Solution LX is definitely worth considering! 🌟

I hate myself for not trying TirTir Cushion Foundation sooner and I have wasted so much money on other foundations 😔 but literally, this is the one I should have used a long time ago!

I bought a TirTir Mask Fit Red Cushion in 23N Sand at YesStyle. I thought it would be too dark for my skin tone but it turns out great! And don’t be fooled by the makeup puff when you pick up the foundation - a single press and you have enough for the whole face. You can see that I applied too much on half of my face but when I pressed the puff on the tissue and spread the foundation to the other half, it became perfect! 😍

⭐ POV: What do I think about the coverage?
✅ The coverage is great and it’s not too thick. It brightens my skin tone naturally and it won’t dry out my skin (I have normal to dry skin).

The product claims that it is smudge-proof and lasts for up to 72 hours! 🤔 I didn’t leave the foundation on my skin for that long but compared to other liquid foundations, it is more long-lasting and won’t be smudged even though I use facial tissue to press my cheeks during the day. Having said that, I do use loose powder to set my makeup, and the foundation is off a bit on my nose area due to sebum production. After all, my makeup still looks natural - not cakey, not dry and I LOVE it ❤️❤️❤️

⭐ Will I recommend it?
✅ Definitely Yes! 10/10 🌟 The product is great and it’s about US$25 - a very good deal when you compare other not-so-great cushion foundations. No wonder it became viral and I see it everywhere on social media 📺

❓Have you tried the TirTir Mask Fit Red Cushion? What do you think about it?

I really enjoy this one. Only thing that could make it better is if it was sweat resistant. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Today, I’m comparing two amazing products: Canmake Cream Cheek in P05 Pale Lilac and Valentino Eye2Cheek Eyeshadow and Blush in 03 Rosa Emozione. Let’s dive in! 💕

💜 Canmake Cream Cheek P05 Pale Lilac: This beautiful pale lilac adds a soft, ethereal glow to your cheeks. The texture is powder to creamy, easy to blend, and leaves your skin glowy. It can be used as a highlighter as the pearly shimmer contained in the product is quite intense.

The powder is fine and smooth, which I love, but the packaging is basic and doesn’t come with an applicator brush.

💖 Valentino Eye2Cheek 03 Rosa Emozione: This luxurious blush doubles as an eyeshadow in a stunning rosy pink shade, with a touch of lavender and light-reflecting pearls. The texture is smooth and easy to blend, with a finely milled powder gliding effortlessly onto the skin.

The packaging is where Valentino truly shines—encased in the signature red and gold, it comes with an attached brush for convenient application. It’s a true statement piece on your vanity!

📝 My Experience:
Both products have a similar texture that’s easy to blend, and the powder is fine and smooth. Valentino has more pink to it, while Canmake has more purple. However, once they are applied to the skin, the colors look quite similar to me, though the shimmery result of Canmake is more obvious. ✨

In terms of packaging, Valentino’s luxurious design definitely stands out. However, the price difference of over $40 is significant. 💸💰

Which one will you choose? Let me know your thoughts! ✨

Here’s how it works: The P-Shot uses platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which is drawn from your own blood, to promote tissue regeneration and improve blood flow in the penile area. By combining the PRP with Botox, A-Cell, and exosomes, we supercharge the effects, helping to repair tissue, stimulate growth, and enhance overall function. The result?

Stronger, longer-lasting erections

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Coola today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, and Octocrylene
- It has a gel cream texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- Works well in my body hair
- Has a natural finish
- Did sting my eyes at the end of the day
- Around 10 pumps to get the necessary amount for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- No added synthetic fragrance, but still has a scent from extracts
- Around $48 for 30mL. Can be purchased from their website.
🔆
I’ve liked the majority of their sunscreens that I’ve tried so far, so I’m always down to try a new one! I like the finish quite a bit, very natural. There's no synthetic fragrance added, but it does have a little bit of a scent to it. I guess from extracts and essential oils probably. My issue with this one is that it did sort of sting my eyes sometimes later on in the day. Also it is very pricey, especially considering it’s only 1 ounce. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

6952,0,8.0,False,331.0,89900.0,"I really liked the Glossier lip line in Grip so I bought another shade, Bit.

Here are my thoughts:

This is for those of you who want a highly pigmented, budge-proof formula (which is not me.)

It worked for the shade grip because I loved it as an all-over-the-lips flush of warm pink, but as a lip liner I didn’t like it because the color was so bright.

Since Bit is described as a warm mauve, I thought it might be my perfect shade but it’s too deep for what I wanted, it’s ultra-pigmented, and it sets so fast that I don’t love the way it looks as a liner or all over the lips. It’s really impossible to smudge and it’s so dark that it just doesn’t look natural on me as a liner.

This is obviously just me being super picky but I wanted to share for those of you who are considering this shade.

~PR~
They has this trio of moisturizers now, and I’ve already tried two of them, the gel and the cream, which got a little bit of changes to them. But this one here is completely new. This is the intensive moisturizer from the water bank hyaluronic acid line.
💧
I think it has pretty standard ingredients when it comes to hydration and moisture so nothing too special there. It does have an added Omega Peptide Complex to help fortify the skin's moisture barrier. I would say there is added fragrance to it. I think it’s a pleasant smell and not too apparent. But if you’re looking out for fragrance, you might want to skip this one.
💧
The interesting thing with this and the number one selling point in my opinion is the texture. It has a sort of thick, almost cream cheese, type of texture. I know that sounds crazy but if you’ve tried the L’Occitane hand cream, it’s a very similar texture to that one, you can almost squish it in your hand, which is really interesting. But once you rub it in your hand and it melts down, you apply it on the skin easily. It dries down very well and is not greasy on the skin. I love this as a night cream, considering I have oily skin.
💧
I feel like moisturizers of this texture are pretty hard to come by so it’s definitely nice to check out. Price-wise it’s decent. It’s in the Sephora price range. If you would check this one out for yourself let me know what you think.

Our patient has a bit of a baby face, which is great—he looks young—but he wanted to look more masculine, so he came to us to sculpt out his chin and jawline. He did a lot of research and decided we were the best and most experienced around for male facial sculpting. What we do is artistry and it is very important that he was made to look more masculine by building out the chin and sharpening the jawline, while keeping him looking perfectly natural. He was thrilled with how his results looked once the filler settled and plans to come to only us for all his future filler needs.

They’re $50 each and they are described as, “A hydrating matte lipstick with a dreamy, airy feel and vivid, clean pigment. Plump, nourish and smooth with a blend of peptides, Vitamins C, E, and Hydro Suede Technology: a volumizing, moisture-locking system that delivers matte pigment without drying or feathering.”

Packaging: Weighted, refillable packaging with a magnetic mirrored cap. It feels very luxurious, but heads up - it’s very bulky. Not practical for me to put in my purse.

Shade: Je Rêve is described as a blushy nude, which could be interpreted a million ways. On the website, the shade looks like a mauve, so when I applied it and saw how rosy red it turned, I was very disappointed. But that will depend on your unique skin tone.

My experience: To me, these are not worth $50. I had the same experience with the Mac powderkiss lipsticks, in that they have that creamy, powdery feel that glides on easily but ends up feeling dry on my lips. The Westman Atelier formula is much more thin and a bit more emollient than the Mac version, but that’s my closest comparison.

My friends have been loving this formula and said it wasn’t drying on them, so this is all subjective! For me to want to spend $50 on a lipstick, I need a moisturizing formula, a blurring effect, and a flattering shade.

7252,25,3.0,False,40.0,476.0,"🥰 Fenty Beauty by Rihanna vs Armani Beauty 🥰

I bought these two foundations at Sephora because I always want to compare the finish of my favorite beauty brands. 😄

🧐 What is Fenty Beauty by Rihanna PRO FILT’R SOFT MATTE LONGWEAR FOUNDATION?

This is a buildable, medium to full coverage foundation that is designed to combat heat, sweat, and shine.

✅ My Thoughts on Fenty Beauty: this is a nice semi-matte foundation that covers my large pores and light pigmentation. It’s a bit thick so I have to use a foundation blender to apply it which makes the whole application process much easier.

🧐 What is Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Perfect Glow Flawless Oil-Free Foundation?

This is an oil-free liquid foundation that provides light to medium coverage and a luminous finish for a natural makeup look.

✅ My Thoughts on Armani Beauty: this is my all-time favorite, if I don’t consider the price, as the coverage is light and buildable. It spreads easily on my skin, so if I’m in a rush, I’ll simply use my fingers to apply the foundation. It gives me a natural finish and makes my skin glow.

🥰 Fenty Beauty by Rihanna vs Armani Beauty 🥰:

For a light to medium daily foundation without worrying about the price ($69 for 30ml), choose Armani Beauty.

For medium to full coverage that lasts all day long, Fenty Beauty is your choice ($40 for 32ml).

My favorite is still Armani Beauty ❤️. I love the weightless finish and subtle glow it provides. I do need to touch up with powder foundation when the weather is humid, but I don’t mind at all.

Having said that, Fenty Beauty has just launched a luminous foundation with hydrating ingredients, so I may change my mind later. 🤯

Price: 
$10

Formula:
A thick, shiny lip balm that's very grippy and long-lasting. It's nourishing, occlusive, and one of my favorite textures ever.

Finish:
Super-shiny, glass-like, smoothing finish aka my favorite finish ever. They practically erase lip lines!

Colors:
Peach- sheer, light milky peach
Watermelon - sheer, light candy pink
Mango - bright orange
Strawberry- tomato red

Scents:
Each lip balm smells like the corresponding name! My favorite scents are peach and mango because they smell the most real. I often find that watermelon and strawberry scents smell a bit artificial and that's the case with these, but honestly, they all smell pretty damn good. I'm just trying to provide as much detail as possible.

You can get 15% off with the code KAIT15!

After losing well over 100 pounds, he accomplished something we all should aspire to—a healthier, stronger version of himself. But after such a significant weight loss, he was left with excess loose skin that diet and exercise simply couldn’t address. 

That’s where my WORLD FAMOUS Gladiator Lipo procedure--along with a tummy tuck--came in to complete his journey. Gladiator Lipo helped sculpt his body, enhancing definition and giving him that chiseled look he worked so hard for. 

The tummy tuck was essential for removing the excess skin around his abdomen, a common concern after major weight loss. While not shown explicitly here, the tummy tuck was key to achieving these incredible results, creating smoother, tighter contours and eliminating that last obstacle to his dream body.

Now, he not only looks amazing—he feels amazing! His confidence has skyrocketed, and he’s enjoying his new body by pushing it to the limit in the gym to only build upon his incredible results! This isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about reclaiming your body and owning your journey.

CJC is one of the absolute hottest peptides on the market currently. This innovative supplement is designed to boost your body's natural production of growth hormones, unleashing a litany of benefits for your fitness journey and overall well-being. 
   CJC works by stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland, which plays a pivotal role in muscle growth, tissue repair, and metabolism regulation. As we age, our natural production of growth hormone declines, but CJC steps in to bridge that gap, revitalizing your body's ability to recover, build lean muscle, and maintain optimal health. 
     
Whether you're an athlete looking to enhance performance, a fitness enthusiast gunning for gains, or simply someone who wants to feel more energized and vibrant, CJC can be a game-changer.  Its ability to accelerate recovery means less downtime between workouts, allowing you to push harder and achieve your goals faster. Plus, the metabolic boost from increased growth hormone levels can aid in fat loss and improve body composition. 
     
But the benefits don't stop there! CJC isn't just about physical gains; it's also about supporting your overall well-being. Improved sleep quality, enhanced cognitive function, and even smoother skin are among the perks reported by users. So, if you're ready to unlock the full potential of your body and embrace a lifestyle of vitality and strength, contact us and give CJC a try today.

🔴 Although I have over 1000 videos on skincare and acne I realized sometimes it's still hard for people to remember which acne products I recommend, vs those that I think are a waste of money!


I decided to create this helpful skincare list of breakout and other skin products that are acne-safe, that I personally recommend and put them all in one place! I hope you find this helpful- enjoy!

This patient first came to us YEARS ago and was actually one of the first gladiators we ever did. Since that time, he has overhauled his lifestyle. He works out like no other and watches what he eats cautiously. However, as the years have passed, the typical effects of aging have set in, such as problem areas of fat and skin laxity. He returned to us to address these issues, as well as to gain a higher degree of sculpting and definition. This is another case that was not at all about weight loss and was more about sheer artistry and sculpting. He trusted only us with his body and that trust was paid off as he ended up being one of our finest results EVER. He did our aftercare protocol to ensure that his healing process was swift and correct, and once he was healed, he was back in the gym getting after it like never before. He also got onto PEPTIDES, amino acids that give the body a directive to perform such as to build muscle. Over a year later and his mind is BLOWN from how sculpted he looks. He loves it and we're thrilled for him.

Dr. Jason Emer is a board-certified dermatologist, specializing in cosmetic, laser and procedural dermatology, including facial sculpting with fillers and hi definition body contouring transformations in West Hollywood, California. Dr. Emer is behind some of Hollywood's most defined bodies, impeccable skin, and chiseled facial features. He is an aesthetic visionary who dares to be different.

After following us for almost two years, she decided that we were the best practice equipped to treat someone of her skin type. She came to us ready to finally have pristine skin that would change the way she feels about herself. She came to us last year for the first time and saw an incredible improvement in the quality of her skin after doing the Halo laser and EMER SKIN. She understood that improving scars and skin is a multi-treatment process, so she came back again to see us so that she could further improve her skin. We got after it with aerolase and another round of Halo, and this time, we also used the Emer Skin Illuminating mask immediately after her treatment to help her skin reach a higher level of radiance. She is so thrilled that she made the decision to come to us, as the improvement in her skin has truly changed her life and boosted her self-confidence beyond measure.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new chemical sunscreen from Cetaphil today! 
🔆
- UV Filters: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, and Avobenzone
- It has a thick cream texture
- No white cast on my skin tone
- No greyness in my facial hair
- Has a natural radiant finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Slightly stings my eyes sometimes
- Around 10-12 pumps to get the necessary amount for proper protection (around 1/2 teaspoon for face/neck)
- Around $20 for 48mL. Can be purchased from retailers like Target or CVS.
🔆
This is definitely a better one for the dry skin folks out there. But still I think there are better drugstore options that are comparable. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

If you haven’t tried this formula, it’s super thick and nourishing, has great grip, an apricot scent, medium pigment, and an ultra-smoothing, glass-like shine.

This new collection definitely has less pigmented than the initial 5 shades, which is a bummer, but they’re still beautiful. You can see on the arm swatches that some of the shades look almost identical in this collection so I don’t think you need all 5.

My favorite shades are fig, berry, lychee, and black cherry.

Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this chemical sunscreen from Anua today!
🔆
- UV Filters: Uvinul T 150, Mexoryl SX, Uvinul A Plus, Parsol SLX, And Tinosorb S 
- It has a gel cream texture, lightweight feel
- No white cast on my skin tone 
- No residue in my facial hair
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural finish
- No added fragrance and essential oils
- Doesn't sting my eyes
- Around $15 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website or retailers like Stylevana or YesStyle. Code SHOPGSG for a discount on Stylevana.
🔆
To everyone telling me that I would like this sunscreen, you were indeed correct. This is such a nice sunscreen. I like that the finish is not overly shiny either. This will definitely be staying in the rotation. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

✨🍒 Fwee Jelly Pot Keyring Set 🍒✨
Meet the cutest multi-use jelly tint that brings a dewy, glassy glow to both lips & cheeks! 💖💋 The juicy & elastic texture fills in lip wrinkles for a flawless look, while the high-shine formula creates an effortless inner glow. 🌟

I got JC03 Juicy Punch, and OMG —i t smells fruity & fresh 🍓🍊! The beautiful red is just the right amount of color for daytime wear. The jello-like texture is almost too cute to use (but of course, I did! 😆). It glides on smoothly, making my dry lips feel hydrated and my cheeks naturally radiant. ✨

💗 Pro tip: I love applying it right after foundation and lightly pressing loose powder to adjust the shine — totally customizable to your style! 😉 Plus, the heart-shaped keyring pendant is just too adorable. 💕

Since I have oily/acne-prone skin, I am used to handling breakouts on my face regularly. But something I've been dealing with more and more has been acne on the rest of my body. Things like back-ne and arm-ne are what I tend to get. Oxy® works as a solid plan for every kind of Ne.

- Maximum Strength Acne Cream Cleanser 
- Sensitive Skin Acne Cream Cleanser
- 3-in-1 Acne Cleansing Pads

The Oxy products feature ingredients like Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide to effectively treat acne. They also have soothing ingredients so the products aren't harsh on the skin. So they're great all over!

We used a combination treatment of facial sculpting with fillers and our world famous tri-vector technique with threads to restore volume to key areas of his face such as his midface and under eyes, while giving him more contour than ever before along his jawline. He was blown away by the results and was thrilled he came to the master of facial rejuvenation. He looks younger and more refreshed already!

Our patient wanted to start her journey to soften her acne scars with an amazing combination of TCA cross and lasers. She has some deep, ice pick scars that have bothered her for years. This is just her first step towards improving her skin, as in order to get her skin where she wants it to be, she plans on coming back for a couple more rounds of treatment. As you can see, there is a clear improvement in the texture of her skin. Notice the redness? This is completely normal and will soon subside provided she diligently continues using the skin care plan we put her on.

No treatment is complete without EMER SKIN. Using our products post-treatment will enhance results to the absolute maximum.

I’ve been using it since I emptied the 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant (pr).
I love both formulas. The Mandelic Acid formula can be used for a much gentler exfoliation with brightening properties, whereas the original (I think) is better suited for thicker, oily skin prone to breakouts, congestion & PIH.
I personally have normal skin, and enjoyed trying and emptying the newer formula and then transitioning on to the original formula. My skin has been thriving! It feels smoother, more clarified and looks glasslike! 10/10 would recommend 🩶 || #paulaschoice
