Happy SUNday! I am reviewing this new tinted mineral sunscreen from Beauty of Joseon today!
🔆
- UV Filters: Zinc Oxide
- It has a light fluid texture
- 12 shades for different skin tones
- Provides a decent about of coverage with a brush
- I did not get pilling
- Has a natural radiant finish
- No added fragrance
- Does not sting my eyes
- Around $20 for 50mL. Can be purchased from their website.
🔆
The shades are pretty nice. I'd say they are flexible considering 2 or 3 could work for me depending on the undertones and what I use on top of it. It lasts on my throughout the day without breaking down or getting too greasy. But if is definitely a radiant finish. If you want matte, you can mattify it with a powder on top. I was able to comfortably apply a good amount of this to get the full protection, but I personally still would use my regular sunscreen and use a thinner layer of this on top as a skin tint, not my standalone sunscreen. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

Love the finish of this one. I feel like so many sunscreens I've tired recently have been on the glowy radiant side of things but this ended up being more of a natural matte finish. Works great for my oily skin throughout the day and reapplies well. It is creamy but lightweight on the skin. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!

I got many people asking me to do a try on or share my thoughts when I posted about getting this recently on my story. But the photo I posted last week is an old photo from when I got this back in December, so I've actually been using this for a while lol. Needless to say, I can say I love it (and the other Danessa Myricks Beauty products I've tried).
✨
Just showing here how I usually use it. I start off with priming using the Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder in Universal to help control my oils throughout the day, and then go into the Skin Tint. This tint is really nice on the skin. Looks very smooth with a nice natural glow. Can be a solid light/medium coverage option. There is more coverage when I use it with a brush, but I used a sponge this day. I follow up with a deeper shade of the Blurring Balm Powder for sort of bronze the perimeter of my face. After locking it in with a setting spray and powder, it's good to go.
✨
Let me know if you have any specific questions about my experience using it, but I'm loving it. It is very quick and easy to apply. It lasts well on me throughout the day, especially with the Blurring Balm Powder as a primer and proper setting after. Just helps to naturally elevate by evening out the appearance of my skin without being too full coverage.

This new launch has quickly become a favorite for this month because of how great the spray/mister is on this. Feels so luxe and the product in it feels that way too. I love to have calming and soothing products like this in my routines to help keep my skin on track with the amount of actives I use. Featured ingredients:

- Strengthening the skin barrier: Ectoin and Panthenol
- Soothing the skin: Cica and Allantoin
- Giving deep hydration: Polyglutamic Acid and Aloe Leaf Juice

If you know another super fine mist, let me know! I'm always looking out for more☝🏾

I tried this a few months ago but put it down because I thought it was just okay. It wasn't giving me the long-lasting mattifying effect I expected from the product. But a recent breakout gave me a much great appreciation for it. That bit of Salicylic Acid was doing a great job on subtlety clear my breakout without being too aggressive.

The other more popular sunscreen from this brand has been talked about so much over the past year, but I see this one picking up some traction. Glow is in the name and it definitely gives a glow with it's radiant finish. Overall, I think probably better for normal to dry skin. Let me know in a comment if you have any other questions!
