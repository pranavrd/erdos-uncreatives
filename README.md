# Erdos : Team Uncreatives
Repository for Erdos Data Science Bootcamp Team Project - Predictors of Social Media engagement within a niche. More info on the team and porject specifics found [here](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/programs/spring-2025/data-science-boot-camp/project-upload
).

## Goal
Our goal is to create a data analysis model on a social media dataset to maximize engagement. Our features will likely be post-data that the poster has control of, such as keywords in post-descriptions, hashtags, and posting time. We may have multiple models that optimize different kinds of engagement (likes vs shares).

## Defining the dataset
We will be working with a social media data set. This will be a database where each row corresponds to a social media post from a fixed platform such as Youtube, TikTok, or Instagram.
The columns may contain metrics such as the following: Influencer username, total likes, total shares, total comments, post description, hashtags, posting time. All influencers and posts will be from a specific content niche. We will be looking at the beauty industry; if time permits, we may do the same analysis for other niches such as gaming or food.

## Stakeholders
The stakeholders of our project include organizations or individuals who would be interested in utilizing our results. This includes social media influencers or businesses with a social media presence  who would like to optimize the performance of their own posts, social media managers who would like to optimize the performance of the posts of their clientele, and social media analytics platforms like Hootsuite or Sprout Social who may be interested in providing this kind of analysis as a service to their customers. 

## Key Preformance Indicators
Key performance indicators are used in business to judge performance and progress toward specific, measurable goals. In our context, a KPI is a measure of the success of our project. 

Our KPI will be the accuracy of the predictive success of our model on new post data.
